 Prompt: write different implementation for the code below
Code:
    public static void copyFile(File from, File to) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(from));
        try {
            OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(to));
            try {
                IoUtils.copyAllBytes(in, out);
            } finally {
                IoUtils.safeClose(out);
            }
        } finally {
            IoUtils.safeClose(in);
        }
    }

ChatGPT response: Sure, here are two alternative implementations for the copyFile method:

Option 1: Using Java's NIO API

arduino
Copy code
public static void copyFile(File from, File to) throws IOException {
    Files.copy(from.toPath(), to.toPath(), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
}
Explanation:

This implementation uses Java's NIO API to copy the contents of one file to another.

The Files.copy method is used to perform the copying operation. This method takes two arguments: the path of the source file and the path of the destination file.

The StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING option is specified to indicate that if the destination file already exists, it should be replaced.

Option 2: Using Apache Commons IO

arduino
Copy code
public static void copyFile(File from, File to) throws IOException {
    FileUtils.copyFile(from, to);
}
Explanation:

This implementation uses the Apache Commons IO library to perform the copying operation.

The FileUtils.copyFile method is used to copy the contents of one file to another. This method takes two arguments: the source file and the destination file.

If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten by default. However, this behavior can be changed by using one of the other copyFile method overloads that takes a third boolean argument to specify whether to overwrite existing files or not.
