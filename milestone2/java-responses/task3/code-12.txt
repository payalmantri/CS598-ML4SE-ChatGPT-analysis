 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent code different from this 
Code:
        void sortVerticesSimpleByY_(AttributeStreamOfInt32 points, int begin_,
                        int end_) {
                if (m_bucket_sort == null)
                        m_bucket_sort = new BucketSort();
                m_bucket_sort.sort(points, begin_, end_, new EditShapeBucketSortHelper(
                                this));
        }
-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: void sortVerticesSimpleByY_(AttributeStreamOfInt32 points, int begin_, int end_) {
    int numVertices = end_ - begin_;
    
    // If there are less than two vertices, no sorting is needed
    if (numVertices < 2) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Copy the vertices to a temporary array
    int[] temp = new int[numVertices];
    for (int i = begin_; i < end_; i++) {
        temp[i - begin_] = points.get(i);
    }
    
    // Sort the temporary array
    Arrays.sort(temp);
    
    // Copy the sorted vertices back to the original attribute stream
    for (int i = 0; i < numVertices; i++) {
        points.set(begin_ + i, temp[i]);
    }
}

Here's how this implementation works:

The sortVerticesSimpleByY_ method is called with the points attribute stream, begin_, and end_.
The number of vertices to be sorted is calculated as numVertices = end_ - begin_.
If there are less than two vertices (i.e., numVertices < 2), no sorting is needed, so the method simply returns.
Otherwise, a temporary integer array temp is created with a size of numVertices.
The vertices to be sorted are copied from the points attribute stream to the temp array using a for loop.
The temp array is sorted using the Arrays.sort() method.
The sorted vertices are copied back from the temp array to the points attribute stream using another for loop.
The method completes and returns.
This implementation achieves the same result as the original code by performing a similar sorting operation but using a temporary array instead of a BucketSort object.
