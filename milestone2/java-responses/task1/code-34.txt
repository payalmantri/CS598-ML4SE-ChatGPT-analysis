This is a method that puts bytes into a circular buffer. Here's a step-by-step description of what the code does:

The method takes three arguments: an array of bytes, the offset within the array to start copying from, and the number of bytes to copy.

It checks if there is enough space in the buffer to put the bytes. If there isn't, it returns 0.

It calculates the limit of the buffer, which is the last index to put + 1. If the put index (idxPut)

This is a method that puts bytes into a circular buffer. Here's a step-by-step description of what the code does:

The method takes three arguments: an array of bytes, the offset within the array to start copying from, and the number of bytes to copy.

It checks if there is enough space in the buffer to put the bytes. If there isn't, it returns 0.

It calculates the limit of the buffer, which is the last index to put + 1. If the put index (idxPut) is less than the get index (idxGet), the limit is set to idxGet. Otherwise, the limit is set to capacity, which is the size of the buffer.

It calculates the number of bytes that can be put in the buffer, which is the minimum of the remaining space in the buffer (limit - idxPut) and the number of bytes to be copied (len).

It copies the bytes from the source array (src) to the buffer, starting at the current put index (idxPut) and continuing for the calculated count.

It updates the put index (idxPut) to reflect the number of bytes that were actually copied.

If the put index (idxPut) has reached the end of the buffer, it checks if there are more bytes to be copied. If there are, it copies them from the beginning of the buffer and updates the put index accordingly. If there aren't, it sets the put index to 0.

It updates the available space in the buffer by adding the number of bytes that were copied.

It returns the number of bytes that were copied.
