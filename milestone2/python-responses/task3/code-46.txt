 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent but different code to the given function
Code:
def fit(self, lrs, n_cycle, wds=None, **kwargs):

        """Method gets an instance of LayerOptimizer and delegates to self.fit_gen(..)

        Note that one can specify a list of learning rates which, when appropriately
        defined, will be applied to different segments of an architecture. This seems
        mostly relevant to ImageNet-trained models, where we want to alter the layers
        closest to the images by much smaller amounts.

        Likewise, a single or list of weight decay parameters can be specified, which
        if appropriate for a model, will apply variable weight decay parameters to
        different segments of the model.

        Args:
            lrs (float or list(float)): learning rate for the model

            n_cycle (int): number of cycles (or iterations) to fit the model for

            wds (float or list(float)): weight decay parameter(s).

            kwargs: other arguments

        Returns:
            None
        """
        self.sched = None
        layer_opt = self.get_layer_opt(lrs, wds)
        return self.fit_gen(self.model, self.data, layer_opt, n_cycle, **kwargs)
