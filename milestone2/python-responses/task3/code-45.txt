 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent but different code to the given function
Code:
def get_layer_opt(self, lrs, wds):

        """Method returns an instance of the LayerOptimizer class, which
        allows for setting differential learning rates for different
        parts of the model.

        An example of how a model maybe differentiated into different parts
        for application of differential learning rates and weight decays is
        seen in ../.../courses/dl1/fastai/conv_learner.py, using the dict
        'model_meta'. Currently, this seems supported only for convolutional
        networks such as VGG-19, ResNet-XX etc.

        Args:
            lrs (float or list(float)): learning rate(s) for the model

            wds (float or list(float)): weight decay parameter(s).

        Returns:
            An instance of a LayerOptimizer
        """
        return LayerOptimizer(self.opt_fn, self.get_layer_groups(), lrs, wds)
