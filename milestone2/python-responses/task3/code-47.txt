 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent but different code to the given function
Code:
def lr_find(self, start_lr=1e-5, end_lr=10, wds=None, linear=False, **kwargs):
        """Helps you find an optimal learning rate for a model.

         It uses the technique developed in the 2015 paper
         `Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks`, where
         we simply keep increasing the learning rate from a very small value,
         until the loss starts decreasing.

        Args:
            start_lr (float/numpy array) : Passing in a numpy array allows you
                to specify learning rates for a learner's layer_groups
            end_lr (float) : The maximum learning rate to try.
            wds (iterable/float)

        Examples:
            As training moves us closer to the optimal weights for a model,
            the optimal learning rate will be smaller. We can take advantage of
            that knowledge and provide lr_find() with a starting learning rate
            1000x smaller than the model's current learning rate as such:

            >> learn.lr_find(lr/1000)

            >> lrs = np.array([ 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2 ])
            >> learn.lr_find(lrs / 1000)

        Notes:
            lr_find() may finish before going through each batch of examples if
            the loss decreases enough.
