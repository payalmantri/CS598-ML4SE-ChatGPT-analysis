    Returns an 2d array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image using the cnn face detector
    If you are using a GPU, this can give you much faster results since the GPU
    can process batches of images at once. If you aren't using a GPU, you don't need this function.

    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.

 Prompt: why would the following code expect to find faces in the provided ranges:
# Test with a single image
    img1 = np.zeros((100, 100, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    img1[10:20, 30:40, :] = 255
    img1[50:60, 70:80, :] = 255
    images = [img1]
    expected_output = [[(10, 40, 20, 30), (50, 80, 60, 70)]]
    assert batch_face_locations(images) == expected_output
-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: The provided code is using the numpy library to create a 100x100 image img1 with 3 color channels (RGB). The color values are set to 0 (black) initially.

The next two lines set the color values of certain regions of the image to 255 (white). Specifically, the following two rectangles are set to white:

A rectangle from row 10 to row 20 and column 30 to column 40
A rectangle from row 50 to row 60 and column 70 to column 80
The batch_face_locations function is then called with this image as input, and the function is expected to return the coordinates of any detected faces in the image.

It's important to note that the batch_face_locations function is using a face detection algorithm to identify faces in the image, which is beyond the scope of this code. However, based on the provided test input image, the function is expected to identify two faces: one in the top rectangle and one in the bottom rectangle.

The expected_output variable is a nested list containing a single list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates of a detected face in the image. The coordinates are in the format (top, right, bottom, left), which is a standard format for bounding boxes in computer vision.

The first tuple in the list corresponds to the detected face in the top rectangle, and the second tuple corresponds to the detected face in the bottom rectangle. The values in each tuple represent the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the bounding box for each detected face, respectively.

In summary, the provided code is testing whether the batch_face_locations function correctly identifies the two faces in the input image and returns their bounding box coordinates in the expected format.

-----------------------------------------
 Prompt: the batch_face_locations function would not identify the rectangle as a face. can you fix this in the unit test
