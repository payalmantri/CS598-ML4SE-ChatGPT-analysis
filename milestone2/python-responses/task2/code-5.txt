 Prompt: what kind of unit test cases would you explore for the above function
Code:
def face_distance(face_encodings, face_to_compare):
    """
    Given a list of face encodings, compare them to a known face encoding and get a euclidean distance
    for each comparison face. The distance tells you how similar the faces are.

    :param faces: List of face encodings to compare
    :param face_to_compare: A face encoding to compare against
    :return: A numpy ndarray with the distance for each face in the same order as the 'faces' array
    """
    if len(face_encodings) == 0:
        return np.empty((0))

    return np.linalg.norm(face_encodings - face_to_compare, axis=1)

ChatGPT response: Here are some unit test cases that could be used to test the face_distance function:

Test with a list of face encodings and a single face encoding that are exactly the same. The output should be a NumPy array with all zeros.

Test with a list of face encodings and a single face encoding that are completely different. The output should be a NumPy array with non-zero values.

Test with an empty list of face encodings. The output should be an empty NumPy array.

Test with a list of face encodings and a single face encoding where the dimensions of the arrays don't match. The function should raise a ValueError.

Test with a list of face encodings where some of the encodings are exactly the same as the face_to_compare encoding. The output should have some values that are exactly zero.

Test with a list of face encodings where some of the encodings are very similar to the face_to_compare encoding, but not exactly the same. The output should have some values that are close to zero.

Test with a large list of face encodings and a single face encoding. This will help to check the performance of the function.

Test with non-face vectors or non-numeric inputs. This will help to check the robustness of the function and ensure it raises appropriate errors when invalid inputs are given.

These test cases should cover a range of scenarios and help ensure that the face_distance function is working correctly and handling edge cases appropriately.

ChatGPT response: The test_similar_faces function tests if the face_distance function is able to correctly compute the Euclidean distance between a face to compare and a list of face encodings, and return an array of distances that indicates how similar each face is to the face to compare.

In this test, we create an array of face encodings, face_encodings, that includes 4 faces, 3 of which are similar to the face to compare, and one that is not similar. We then call the face_distance function with face_encodings and face_to_compare as arguments.

The expected output is an array that includes the Euclidean distance between face_to_compare and each face in face_encodings. Since the first 3 faces in face_encodings are similar to face_to_compare, we expect their distances to be smaller than the distance to the last face in face_encodings.

To validate the correctness of the output, we create an expected_output array with the expected distances, based on the similarity of the faces. We then compare the expected output with the actual output using the np.allclose function, which returns True if all elements in the two arrays are equal within a certain tolerance. Here, we set the relative tolerance rtol to 1e-3, which means that the test will pass if the absolute difference between each element in expected_output and output is less than 1e-3 times the larger value of the two elements. If the test passes, we know that the face_distance function correctly computes the distance between the faces and returns an array of distances that indicates how similar each face is to the face to compare.
