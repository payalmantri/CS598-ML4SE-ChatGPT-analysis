 Prompt: what does the following code do?
Code:
def lr_find2(self, start_lr=1e-5, end_lr=10, num_it = 100, wds=None, linear=False, stop_dv=True, **kwargs):
        """A variant of lr_find() that helps find the best learning rate. It doesn't do
        an epoch but a fixed num of iterations (which may be more or less than an epoch
        depending on your data).
        At each step, it computes the validation loss and the metrics on the next
        batch of the validation data, so it's slower than lr_find().

        Args:
            start_lr (float/numpy array) : Passing in a numpy array allows you
                to specify learning rates for a learner's layer_groups
            end_lr (float) : The maximum learning rate to try.
            num_it : the number of iterations you want it to run
            wds (iterable/float)
            stop_dv : stops (or not) when the losses starts to explode.
        """
        self.save('tmp')
        layer_opt = self.get_layer_opt(start_lr, wds)
        self.sched = LR_Finder2(layer_opt, num_it, end_lr, linear=linear, metrics=self.metrics, stop_dv=stop_dv)
        self.fit_gen(self.model, self.data, layer_opt, num_it//len(self.data.trn_dl) + 1, all_val=True, **kwargs)
        self.load('tmp')

ChatGPT response: The given code defines a method lr_find2() in a class. This method is a variant of lr_find() method and helps to find the best learning rate for a model. It runs for a fixed number of iterations specified by the num_it parameter, instead of running for a full epoch. At each iteration, it computes the validation loss and metrics on the next batch of validation data. It takes several parameters like start_lr (the initial learning rate to start with), end_lr (the maximum learning rate to try), wds (weight decay parameter), stop_dv (to stop if the loss starts exploding). It saves the current model as a temporary checkpoint, initializes the layer optimizer with start_lr and wds, creates a learning rate schedule using LR_Finder2 class, and fits the model using fit_gen() method for the specified number of iterations. Finally, it loads the saved model checkpoint.
