 Prompt: can you explain what the following function does::
Code:
def is_nested_list_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is list-like, and that all of its elements
    are also list-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_list_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has list-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3]])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like([{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like(["foo"])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3], 1])
    False

    Notes
    -----
    This won't reliably detect whether a consumable iterator (e. g.
    a generator) is a nested-list-like without consuming the iterator.
    To avoid consuming it, we always return False if the outer container
    doesn't define `__len__`.

    --------

            len(obj) > 0 and all(is_list_like(item) for item in obj))

ChatGPT response: This function checks whether an object is "list-like", meaning it is a list or an object that can be treated like a list (e.g. a tuple). It also checks that all elements of the list (if it is a list) are themselves "list-like".

The function first checks whether the object is list-like using the is_list_like() function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided, but likely checks whether the object is a list, tuple, or other sequence type. If the object is list-like, the function then checks whether it has a length (using the hasattr() function) and whether that length is greater than 0. Finally, the function uses a generator expression and the all() function to check whether all elements of the object (if it is a list) are also list-like.

The function returns True if the object is list-like and all of its elements (if it is a list) are also list-like, and False otherwise.

The function also includes some additional notes and examples in its docstring, as well as a reference to another related function (is_list_like()).

 Prompt: what does the following code do?

-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: It is common to have separate functions for related but distinct tasks in programming. In this case, is_list_like() and is_nested_list_like() serve slightly different purposes, although they are related.

is_list_like() checks whether an object is "list-like", meaning it is a list or an object that can be treated like a list (e.g. a tuple). This is a useful function to have in many situations, because sometimes you want to treat an object as a list even if it is not a true Python list object. For example, you might want to loop over an object and treat each element as if it were in a list, even if the object is not actually a list.

is_nested_list_like() builds on is_list_like() and checks whether an object is a list-like object where all of its elements are also list-like. This is a more specific check than is_list_like(), and it is useful in cases where you want to ensure that not only is an object list-like, but that it contains only other list-like objects.

In some cases, it might make sense to combine these functions into a single function that checks both conditions at once. However, in this particular implementation, the two functions are kept separate for clarity and modularity. By keeping the functions separate, it is easier to modify or reuse them in other parts of the code without affecting the behavior of the other function. Additionally, is_list_like() may be useful in other parts of the code that don't require the additional constraint of nested list-like objects, so it makes sense to have it as a separate function.
