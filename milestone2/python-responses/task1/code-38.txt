 Prompt: what does the following code do?
Code:
def _symmetric_warp(c, magnitude:partial(uniform,size=4)=0, invert=False):
    "Apply symmetric warp of `magnitude` to `c`."
    m = listify(magnitude, 4)
    targ_pts = [[-1-m[3],-1-m[1]], [-1-m[2],1+m[1]], [1+m[3],-1-m[0]], [1+m[2],1+m[0]]]
    return _do_perspective_warp(c, targ_pts, invert)

-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: The given code defines a function named _symmetric_warp that applies a symmetric warp of a given magnitude to an input c using perspective transformation. The function takes three parameters:

c: This parameter is the input image that needs to be transformed.
magnitude: This is an optional parameter that specifies the magnitude of the warp. It defaults to 0 if not provided.
invert: This is another optional parameter that specifies whether the warp should be inverted. It defaults to False if not provided.
The function first generates target points that are used to specify the transformation to be applied to the input image. These target points are generated based on the provided magnitude using the listify function, which converts magnitude to a list of length 4 if it is not already a list. The targ_pts list is then generated by computing four points that correspond to the corners of a rectangle that is slightly larger than the original image. The magnitude values are used to offset these corner points.

Finally, the _do_perspective_warp function is called with the input image c and the targ_pts as arguments. The _do_perspective_warp function applies a perspective transformation to the input image based on the provided target points. The invert parameter can be used to invert the warp, effectively reversing the transformation.
