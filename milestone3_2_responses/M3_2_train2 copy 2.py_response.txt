Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
In the show_prediction_labels_on_image function, the line name = name.encode("UTF-8") is used to convert the name of the recognized person to a byte string in UTF-8 format. This is necessary because the draw.text() function of the Pillow module, which is used to display the name of the recognized person, expects a byte string as input.

If the name of the person contains non-ASCII characters or characters outside of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), converting it to a byte string in UTF-8 format ensures that the name can be properly displayed by the draw.text() function. If the name is not converted to a byte string, Pillow may raise an exception with a message indicating that the text is not encoded in UTF-8 format.
Code:
def show_prediction_labels_on_image(img_path, predictions):
    """
    Shows the face recognition results visually.

    :param img_path: path to image to be recognized
    :param predictions: results of the predict function
    :return:
    """
    pil_image = Image.open(img_path).convert("RGB")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

    for name, (top, right, bottom, left) in predictions:
        # Draw a box around the face using the Pillow module
        draw.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline=(0, 0, 255))

        # There's a bug in Pillow where it blows up with non-UTF-8 text
        # when using the default bitmap font
        name = name.encode("UTF-8")

        # Draw a label with a name below the face
        text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(name)
        draw.rectangle(((left, bottom - text_height + 10), (right, bottom)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))
        draw.text((left + 6, bottom - text_height - 5), name, fill=(255, 255, 255, 255))

    # Remove the drawing library from memory as per the Pillow docs
    del draw

    # Display the resulting image
    pil_image.show()The code is not buggy. The line `name = name.encode("UTF-8")` is used to convert the name of the recognized person to a byte string in UTF-8 format, which is necessary for displaying the name using the `draw.text()` function of the Pillow module. This is a common practice when working with text in Python, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters or characters outside of the Unicode BMP.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
There is a bug in the code related to the placement of the name label below the face. Specifically, the line `draw.rectangle(((left, bottom - text_height + 10), (right, bottom)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))` should be modified to `draw.rectangle(((left, bottom), (right, bottom + text_height)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))`. This is because the original line draws a rectangle that is too high up, resulting in the name label being partially cut off.
