Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function called "train" that trains a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for face recognition.

The function takes in the following parameters:

train_dir: A directory containing sub-directories for each known person with their images.
model_save_path: An optional path to save the trained model on disk.
n_neighbors: An optional number of neighbors to weigh in classification. If not specified, it is chosen automatically.
knn_algo: An optional parameter that specifies the underlying data structure to support KNN. The default is 'ball_tree'.
verbose: An optional parameter that determines the verbosity of training.
The function first loops through each person in the training set and then through each training image for the current person. It loads each image file, detects the face bounding box in the image, and encodes the face using the face_recognition library. If there is more than one face in an image, or if no face is detected, the image is skipped.

The function then determines the number of neighbors to use for weighting in the KNN classifier, based on the size of the training set. Finally, it creates a KNN classifier using the scikit-learn library, trains it on the training set, and saves the trained model to disk (if a save path is provided). The trained KNN classifier is returned as the output of the function.
Code:
def train(train_dir, model_save_path=None, n_neighbors=None, knn_algo='ball_tree', verbose=False):
    """

    :param train_dir: directory that contains a sub-directory for each known person, with its name.

    return knn_clfThere seems to be a bug in the code. 

In the following lines of code: 

```
if n_neighbors is not None:
    n_neighbors = int(round(math.sqrt(len(X))))
```

If the `n_neighbors` parameter is provided, the code ignores it and automatically selects the number of neighbors based on the number of images in the training set. It should be changed to:

```
if n_neighbors is None:
    n_neighbors = int(round(math.sqrt(len(X))))
```

This will only set the value of `n_neighbors` to the default value if it was not provided as an argument.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
I do not see any bugs in the provided code. However, it is possible that there could be issues with the implementation of the dependencies (such as the face_recognition library or the scikit-learn library) that this code relies on.
