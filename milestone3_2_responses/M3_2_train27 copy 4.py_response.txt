Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function called is_sequence() that takes an object as input and checks whether it is a sequence of objects. The function first checks whether the input object is iterable (i.e., it can be looped over) and has a length associated with it using the iter() and len() functions respectively. If these conditions are met, the function then checks whether the input object is a string or bytes using the isinstance() function. If the input object satisfies all these conditions, the function returns True, indicating that the object is a sequence of objects. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function also includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples of how to use it.
Code:
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        len(obj)   # Has a length associated with it.
        return not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except (TypeError, AttributeError):
        return True
The updated code looks correct to me. The `TypeError` and `AttributeError` exceptions in the `except` block will catch the cases where the `iter()` or `len()` functions raise an error, which will happen if the input object is not iterable or doesn't have a length associated with it. By catching these exceptions, the function will return `False` in these cases instead of raising an error, which is what we want.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the provided code is that the `len(obj)` statement in the try block does not have any effect on the function's behavior, as it is not checked or used anywhere in the function. Therefore, the `len(obj)` statement can be removed without affecting the function's functionality.
