Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The code defines a Python function called face_landmarks that takes an image of a face and returns a list of dictionaries containing the locations of various facial features (such as the eyes, nose, and lips) for each face in the image. The function accepts three parameters:

face_image: The image of the face to be processed.
face_locations (optional): A list of face locations to check. If not provided, the function will attempt to detect the face locations automatically.
model (optional): Specifies the model to use. The default value is "large", which returns a comprehensive set of landmarks, but is slower than "small" which only returns 5 points.
The function first calls the _raw_face_landmarks function, which is not shown in this code snippet but likely uses a machine learning model to detect facial landmarks on the input image. The landmarks are then converted to tuples for easier processing and a set of landmarks is returned in the form of a list of dictionaries, one for each face detected in the input image. The keys of each dictionary correspond to facial features and the values are the coordinates of the points that make up each feature. The coordinates are specified as (x,y) tuples. If an invalid model argument is provided, the function will raise a ValueError.
Code:
def face_landmarks(face_image, face_locations=None, model="large"):
    """
    Given an image, returns a dict of face feature locations (eyes, nose, etc) for each face in the image

    :param face_image: image to search
    :param face_locations: Optionally provide a list of face locations to check.
    :param model: Optional - which model to use. "large" (default) or "small" which only returns 5 points but is faster.
    :return: A list of dicts of face feature locations (eyes, nose, etc)
    """
    landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, face_locations, model)
    landmarks_as_tuples = [[(p.x, p.y) for p in landmark.parts()] for landmark in landmarks]

    # For a definition of each point index, see https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*AbEg31EgkbXSQehuNJBlWg.png
    if model == 'large':
        return [{
            "chin": points[0:17],
            "left_eyebrow": points[17:22],
            "right_eyebrow": points[22:27],

        } for points in landmarks_as_tuples]
    elif model == 'small':
        return [{
            "nose_tip": [points[0]],
            "left_eye": points[2:4],
            "right_eye": points[0:2],
        } for points in landmarks_as_tuples]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid landmarks model type. Supported models are ['small', 'large'].")
Based on the provided information, the code appears to be correct and not buggy. It defines a Python function called `face_landmarks` that takes an image of a face and returns a list of dictionaries containing the locations of various facial features for each face in the image. The function accepts three parameters: `face_image`, `face_locations` (optional), and `model` (optional). 

The function first calls the `_raw_face_landmarks` function to detect facial landmarks on the input image. The landmarks are then converted to tuples and a set of landmarks is returned in the form of a list of dictionaries, one for each face detected in the input image. 

If an invalid model argument is provided, the function will raise a ValueError. The function is properly documented with a docstring that explains the purpose of the function and the meaning of the input and output parameters. 

However, without the implementation of `_raw_face_landmarks` function, it is not possible to completely evaluate the correctness of the code.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
Without additional information, it is not possible to determine the bug in the code. The code appears to be correct and follows best practices in Python for function definition and documentation. 

If you provide more information on the bug you encountered or the error message you received, I can help you better in identifying the issue.
