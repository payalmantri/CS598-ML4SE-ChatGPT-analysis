Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
def load_image_file(file, mode='RGB'):
    """
    Loads an image file (.jpg, .png, etc) into a numpy array

    :param file: image file name or file object to load
    :param mode: format to convert the image to. Only 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and 'L' (black and white) are supported.
    :return: image contents as numpy array
    """
    im = PIL.Image.open(file)
    if mode:
        im = im.convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)
Code:

    allowed_modes = ['RGB', 'L']
    if mode in allowed_modes:

    im = PIL.Image.open(file).convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)The ChatGPT generated code seems to have a bug. In the `if` statement, the condition is checking if `mode` is in the list of allowed modes, and if it is, a `ValueError` is raised. This is the opposite of what the code should be doing. The condition should check if `mode` is not in the list of allowed modes, and if it is not, a `ValueError` should be raised. 

Here's the corrected code:

```
def load_image_file(file, mode='RGB'):
    """
    Loads an image file (.jpg, .png, etc) into a numpy array

    :param file: image file name or file object to load
    :param mode: format to convert the image to. Only 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and 'L' (black and white) are supported.
    :return: image contents as numpy array
    """
    allowed_modes = ['RGB', 'L']
    if mode not in allowed_modes:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid mode '{mode}'. Allowed modes are {allowed_modes}.")
    im = PIL.Image.open(file).convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)
```
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The code generated by ChatGPT is buggy. In the if statement, the code checks if the mode is in the allowed modes list, and if it is, it raises a ValueError with an error message saying that the mode is invalid. This is the opposite of what it should be doing. If the mode is not in the allowed modes list, it should raise a ValueError with an error message saying that the mode is invalid. So the correct condition should be `if mode not in allowed_modes:`.
