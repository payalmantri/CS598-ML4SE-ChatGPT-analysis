Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The function maybe_convert_platform_interval takes an array-like object values as input and applies platform conversion to it, with special handling for IntervalArray. The function is essentially a wrapper around the function maybe_convert_platform, which does the actual platform conversion. The purpose of maybe_convert_platform_interval is to alter the default return dtype of maybe_convert_platform in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.

Specifically, if values is an empty list or tuple, the function returns an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64, rather than the default object dtype. This is because object dtype is not allowed for IntervalArray.

If values is a categorical data type, it is converted to a NumPy array using np.asarray before being passed to maybe_convert_platform.

Overall, maybe_convert_platform_interval is a utility function that provides a convenient way to apply platform conversion to arrays, with special handling for certain cases.
Code:
def maybe_convert_platform_interval(values):
    """
    Try to do platform conversion, with special casing for IntervalArray.
    Wrapper around maybe_convert_platform that alters the default return
    dtype in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.  For example,
    empty lists return with integer dtype instead of object dtype, which is
    prohibited for IntervalArray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array-like

    Returns
    -------
    array
    """
    if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) > 0:
        # GH 19016
        # empty lists/tuples get object dtype by default, but this is not
        # prohibited for IntervalArray, so coerce to integer instead
        return np.array([], dtype=np.int64)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(values):
        values = np.asarray(values)

    return maybe_convert_platform(values)
The code is correct. The bug in the original code was fixed by changing `len(values) != 0` to `len(values) > 0` in the first conditional statement, which correctly handles the case of an empty list or tuple. The code now correctly handles the special case of an empty list or tuple by returning an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code provided above is in the `if` statement that checks whether `values` is an empty list or tuple. The condition `len(values) != 0` should be changed to `len(values) == 0`. The current condition will return an empty array of dtype `np.int64` when `values` is not an empty list or tuple, and the correct behavior is to return the original `values` array in this case.
