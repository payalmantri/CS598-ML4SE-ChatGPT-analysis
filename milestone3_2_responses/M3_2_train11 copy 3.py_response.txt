Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code is a Python function face_encodings() that takes an input image containing one or more human faces and returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each face in the image.

The function first calls another internal function _raw_face_landmarks() that detects and returns the facial landmarks (i.e., the location of important facial features like eyes, nose, etc.) in the input image. The landmarks can be either detected automatically if the optional argument known_face_locations is not provided or can be passed explicitly if known in advance.

Then, for each set of raw facial landmarks, the function computes the face encodings using another internal function face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(). The num_jitters parameter specifies the number of times to re-sample the face when calculating the encoding to improve accuracy (higher num_jitters means more accurate but slower encoding).

Finally, the function returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each detected face in the input image.
Code:
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations="", num_jitters=1):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
    raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="small")
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
There is no syntax error in the provided code, but there is a potential bug. 

The default value for the `known_face_locations` parameter is an empty string `""`, which is not a valid input type for the `_raw_face_landmarks()` function. This could lead to an error when calling the function if the user does not explicitly pass a value for `known_face_locations`.

A better default value for `known_face_locations` could be `None`, which would be a valid input type for the function and allow it to detect facial landmarks automatically. 

Additionally, the `num_jitters` parameter should have a default value greater than 1 to ensure accurate face encodings. The current default value of 1 may result in less accurate encodings.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that the default value of the `known_face_locations` parameter is an empty string (`""`) instead of `None`. This can cause unexpected behavior when the function is called without providing a value for the `known_face_locations` parameter. To fix this, the default value should be changed to `None`.
