Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The function maybe_convert_platform_interval takes an array-like object values as input and applies platform conversion to it, with special handling for IntervalArray. The function is essentially a wrapper around the function maybe_convert_platform, which does the actual platform conversion. The purpose of maybe_convert_platform_interval is to alter the default return dtype of maybe_convert_platform in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.

Specifically, if values is an empty list or tuple, the function returns an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64, rather than the default object dtype. This is because object dtype is not allowed for IntervalArray.

If values is a categorical data type, it is converted to a NumPy array using np.asarray before being passed to maybe_convert_platform.

Overall, maybe_convert_platform_interval is a utility function that provides a convenient way to apply platform conversion to arrays, with special handling for certain cases.
Code:
def maybe_convert_platform_interval(values):
    """
    Try to do platform conversion, with special casing for IntervalArray.
    Wrapper around maybe_convert_platform that alters the default return
    dtype in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.  For example,
    empty lists return with integer dtype instead of object dtype, which is
    prohibited for IntervalArray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array-like

    Returns
    -------
    array
    """
    if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) < 0:
        # GH 19016
        # empty lists/tuples get object dtype by default, but this is not
        # prohibited for IntervalArray, so coerce to integer instead
        return np.array([], dtype=np.int64)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(values):
        values = np.asarray(values)

    return maybe_convert_platform(values)
The code has a bug. In the first `if` statement, the condition should be `len(values) == 0` instead of `len(values) < 0`. As a result, the intended behavior of returning an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64 for empty lists or tuples is not achieved, since the condition is always False.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug is in the following line of code:

```
if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) < 0:
```

The condition `len(values) < 0` will always be `False`, as the length of a list or tuple cannot be negative. It should be `len(values) == 0` instead.
