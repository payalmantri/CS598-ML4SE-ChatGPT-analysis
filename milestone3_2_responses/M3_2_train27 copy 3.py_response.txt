Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function called is_sequence() that takes an object as input and checks whether it is a sequence of objects. The function first checks whether the input object is iterable (i.e., it can be looped over) and has a length associated with it using the iter() and len() functions respectively. If these conditions are met, the function then checks whether the input object is a string or bytes using the isinstance() function. If the input object satisfies all these conditions, the function returns True, indicating that the object is a sequence of objects. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function also includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples of how to use it.
Code:
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        len(obj)   # Has a length associated with it.
        return not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except (TypeError):
        return True
The code is buggy. The `len(obj)` line should not be there. Since `len()` can be called on any object that defines the `__len__()` method, it can raise a TypeError for objects that do not have a `__len__()` method. Therefore, the try-except block should only include the `iter()` line. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        return not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except TypeError:
        return False
```
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that it does not correctly handle the TypeError that may arise when calling `len(obj)` on an object that is not iterable. If an object is not iterable, calling `iter(obj)` will raise a TypeError, which is caught by the try-except block and will cause the function to return False. However, if an object is iterable but does not have a length associated with it (e.g., a generator), calling `len(obj)` will also raise a TypeError, which is not caught by the try-except block and will cause the function to raise an unhandled exception. To fix the bug, the except clause should catch both AttributeError and TypeError, and return False in both cases.
