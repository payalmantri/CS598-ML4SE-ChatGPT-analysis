Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This code defines a Python function _raw_face_locations that takes an image (as a numpy array), the number of times to upsample the image looking for faces, and the face detection model to use as input parameters. The function returns a list of dlib 'rect' objects that represent the bounding boxes of the human faces found in the image.

The function first checks the value of the model parameter. If the model is set to "cnn", the function calls the cnn_face_detector function to perform face detection using a deep learning-based model. If the model is set to any other value (i.e., "hog"), the function calls the face_detector function to perform face detection using a traditional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm.

In summary, the _raw_face_locations function is a utility function that can detect faces in an image using either a HOG-based algorithm or a deep learning-based model, depending on the value of the model parameter.
Code:
def _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample=1, model="hog"):
    """
    Returns an array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image

    :param img: An image (as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param model: Which face detection model to use. "hog" is less accurate but faster on CPUs. "cnn" is a more accurate
                  deep-learning model which is GPU/CUDA accelerated (if available). The default is "hog".
    :return: A list of dlib 'rect' objects of found face locations
    """
    if model < "cnn":
        return cnn_face_detector(img, number_of_times_to_upsample)
    else:
        return face_detector(img, number_of_times_to_upsample)The code is buggy. The if statement should compare the value of the `model` parameter to "cnn" using `==`, not `<`.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the conditional statement inside the `_raw_face_locations` function where it checks the value of the `model` parameter. The condition `if model < "cnn":` should be changed to `if model == "hog":` to properly check if the model is set to "hog". This is because the `model` parameter is a string, and the current condition compares string values using the less than operator, which would result in incorrect behavior.
