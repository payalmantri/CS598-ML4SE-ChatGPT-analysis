Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
def load_image_file(file, mode='RGB'):
    """

    :param mode: format to convert the image to. Only 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and 'L' (black and white) are supported.

    im = PIL.Image.open(file)
    if mode:
        im = im.convert(mode)

    allowed_modes = ['RGB', 'L']
    if mode not in allowed_modes:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid mode '{mode}'. Allowed modes are {allowed_modes}.")
    im = PIL.Image.open(file).convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)Yes, the code is buggy. In the ChatGPT-generated code, the `mode` parameter is set to `'RRR'`, which is not a valid mode for image conversion. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised in the code, as it should, because only `'RGB'` and `'L'` are allowed modes. However, the error message should be updated to match the `raise` statement in the `original` code, which uses a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError`.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
Yes, the code is buggy. 

The bug is in the `load_image_file` function where the default value for the `mode` parameter is set to `'RRR'`, which is not one of the allowed modes ('RGB', 'L'). 

In addition, the error message in the `raise` statement should be changed from `TypeError` to `ValueError`. The corrected function would look like this:

```
def load_image_file(file, mode='RGB'):
    """
    Loads an image file (.jpg, .png, etc) into a numpy array

    :param file: image file name or file object to load
    :param mode: format to convert the image to. Only 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and 'L' (black and white) are supported.

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid mode '{mode}'. Allowed modes are {allowed_modes}.")
    im = PIL.Image.open(file).convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)
