Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function that takes an image (as a NumPy array) and finds the locations of human faces in the image. The function has three parameters:

img: The input image.
number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image to look for smaller faces.
model: Which face detection model to use. The default is "hog", which is less accurate but faster on CPUs. If set to "cnn", a more accurate deep-learning model will be used, which requires GPU/CUDA acceleration.
The function first checks the value of model. If it is "cnn", the _raw_face_locations() function is called with the img, number_of_times_to_upsample, and "cnn" parameters to find the face locations in the image. For each detected face, the _rect_to_css() function is called to convert the face location from rectangle format to css format. Then, the _trim_css_to_bounds() function is called to trim the face location to be within the bounds of the input image. Finally, the trimmed face location is appended to a list and the list is returned.

If model is not "cnn", the same process is followed, except that the _rect_to_css() function is called with the face location directly instead of calling .rect attribute.
Code:
def face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample=1, model="hhh"):
    """
    Returns an array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image

    :param img: An image (as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param model: Which face detection model to use. "hog" is less accurate but faster on CPUs. "cnn" is a more accurate
                  deep-learning model which is GPU/CUDA accelerated (if available). The default is "hog".
    :return: A list of tuples of found face locations in css (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    if model == "cnn":
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, "cnn")]
    else:
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, model)]The code seems to be buggy. 

The default value for the `model` parameter is set to "hhh", which is not a valid option. The valid options are "hog" and "cnn". 

To fix the bug, the default value for `model` should be changed to "hog" or "cnn".
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that the default value for the `model` parameter is set to "hhh", which is not a valid value for this parameter. It should be set to "hog" instead.
