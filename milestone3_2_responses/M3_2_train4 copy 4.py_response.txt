Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function named _trim_css_to_bounds that takes two arguments: css and image_shape. The purpose of the function is to trim a rectangle represented by a plain tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order, making sure that the values are within the bounds of the image represented by image_shape.

The function returns a new plain tuple with the trimmed values in the same order (top, right, bottom, left). The first element in the tuple is the maximum of the top value and 0, ensuring that it does not go above the image. The second element is the minimum of the right value and the width of the image, ensuring that it does not go beyond the right edge of the image. The third element is the minimum of the bottom value and the height of the image, ensuring that it does not go below the bottom edge of the image. Finally, the fourth element is the maximum of the left value and 0, ensuring that it does not go beyond the left edge of the image.

Overall, this function is useful for image processing applications that need to ensure that rectangles are within the bounds of an image, to avoid errors or invalid output.
Code:
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    return max(css[0], 0), min(css[1], image_shape[1]), max(css[2], image_shape[0]), max(css[3], 0)The code has a bug. Specifically, the second element of the returned tuple should be the minimum of the right value and the width of the image (i.e., image_shape[1]), but the current code uses min(css[2], image_shape[1]) instead of min(css[1], image_shape[1]). Similarly, the third element should be the minimum of the bottom value and the height of the image (i.e., image_shape[0]), but the current code uses max(css[2], image_shape[0]) instead of min(css[2], image_shape[0]).
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
There is a bug in the second line of the return statement. Specifically, `min(css[2], image_shape[1])` should be replaced with `min(css[2], image_shape[0])`. The former checks if the bottom value is within the width of the image, while it should check if it's within the height of the image.
