Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This code defines a function called predict that can be used for facial recognition. The function takes in a path to an image (X_img_path), an optional KNN classifier object (knn_clf), an optional path to a pickled KNN classifier (model_path), and an optional distance threshold for face classification (distance_threshold).

The function first checks if the image path is valid and loads the KNN model if it is not provided as an input. It then loads the image and finds the locations of any faces in the image. If there are no faces in the image, an empty result is returned. If faces are found, the function finds the encodings for each face and uses the KNN model to find the best matches for each face.

If the closest distance for a face is less than or equal to the distance threshold, the function predicts the class of the face using the KNN model. Otherwise, the face is classified as "unknown". Finally, the function returns a list of tuples that contain the predicted class and bounding box coordinates for each recognized face in the image. If no faces are recognized, an empty list is returned.

    return [(pred, loc) if rec else ("unknown", loc) for pred, loc, rec in zip(knn_clf.predict(faces_encodings), X_face_locations, are_matches)]The code is buggy. The check for the length of X_face_locations is the opposite of what it should be. If len(X_face_locations) equals 0, then no faces were found in the image and the function should return an empty list. If len(X_face_locations) is greater than 0, then the function should proceed with finding the encodings for each face and using the KNN model to find the best matches for each face.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
Based on the code provided, it seems that there is a bug in the following line:
```
if len(X_face_locations) != 0:
        return []
```
This condition should be checking if there are faces in the image, so the correct condition should be:
```
if len(X_face_locations) == 0:
        return []
```
With the original condition, if there are faces in the image, the function will return an empty list and if there are no faces in the image, the function will continue with the rest of the code.
