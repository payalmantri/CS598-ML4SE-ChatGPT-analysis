Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code snippet is a function named _int_size_to_type that takes an integer argument size and returns a datatype from the Catalyst library based on the size of the integer. The output of the function is not specified as it is just a definition of a function.

To use the function, you can call it with an integer argument like this:

scss
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.types import *
size = 16
data_type = _int_size_to_type(size)
print(data_type)
The output of this code will depend on the value of size passed as an argument to the function. If size is less than or equal to 8, the function will return ByteType, if size is less than or equal to 16, the function will return ShortType, if size is less than or equal to 32, the function will return IntegerType, and if size is less than or equal to 64, the function will return LongType. If size is greater than 64, the function will not return anything as there is no condition for such a case.
Code:
def _int_size_to_type(size):
    """
    Return the Catalyst datatype from the size of integers.
    """
    if size > 8:
        return ByteType
    if size <= 16:
        return ShortType
    if size <= 32:
        return IntegerType
    if size <= 64:
        return LongType
The code is buggy. The first condition `if size > 8:` is incorrect, it should be `if size <= 8:` because if size is less than or equal to 8, the function should return ByteType, not if size is greater than 8.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the first conditional statement `if size > 8`, where it should be checking for `size <= 8` instead. The current code will return `ByteType` for sizes greater than 8, which is incorrect. The corrected code should be:

```
def _int_size_to_type(size):
    """
    Return the Catalyst datatype from the size of integers.
    """
    if size <= 8:
        return ByteType
    if size <= 16:
        return ShortType
    if size <= 32:
        return IntegerType
    if size <= 64:
        return LongType
```
