Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This function takes a list of images (in the form of numpy arrays) and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect human faces in each image. The number_of_times_to_upsample parameter determines how many times to upsample each image to detect smaller faces. The batch_size parameter determines the number of images to process at once, which can be more efficient when using a GPU.

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the detected face locations in CSS (top, right, bottom, left) order for each image in the input list. The convert_cnn_detections_to_css function is an internal helper function that converts the CNN detections to CSS format.
Code:
def batch_face_locations(images, number_of_times_to_upsample=-1, batch_size=128):
    """
    Returns an 2d array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image using the cnn face detector
    If you are using a GPU, this can give you much faster results since the GPU
    can process batches of images at once. If you aren't using a GPU, you don't need this function.

    :param img: A list of images (each as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param batch_size: How many images to include in each GPU processing batch.
    :return: A list of tuples of found face locations in css (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    def convert_cnn_detections_to_css(detections):
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), images[0].shape) for face in detections]

    raw_detections_batched = _raw_face_locations_batched(images, number_of_times_to_upsample, batch_size)

    return list(map(convert_cnn_detections_to_css, raw_detections_batched))The code seems to have a bug in the convert_cnn_detections_to_css function. The function is using the shape of the first image in the input list to trim the CSS coordinates, which may result in incorrect bounding boxes for other images in the list with different shapes. The correct way would be to use the shape of the corresponding image for each bounding box. 

Additionally, the number_of_times_to_upsample parameter has a default value of -1, which is not a valid value. It should default to 1 instead, or have a different default value that makes more sense.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
There is a bug in the `convert_cnn_detections_to_css` function where it uses `images[0].shape` instead of `face.image_shape`. The `face` object has an `image_shape` attribute that should be used instead of `images[0].shape`.
