Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The function maybe_convert_platform_interval takes an array-like object values as input and applies platform conversion to it, with special handling for IntervalArray. The function is essentially a wrapper around the function maybe_convert_platform, which does the actual platform conversion. The purpose of maybe_convert_platform_interval is to alter the default return dtype of maybe_convert_platform in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.

Specifically, if values is an empty list or tuple, the function returns an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64, rather than the default object dtype. This is because object dtype is not allowed for IntervalArray.

If values is a categorical data type, it is converted to a NumPy array using np.asarray before being passed to maybe_convert_platform.

Overall, maybe_convert_platform_interval is a utility function that provides a convenient way to apply platform conversion to arrays, with special handling for certain cases.
Code:
def maybe_convert_platform_interval(values):
    """
    Try to do platform conversion, with special casing for IntervalArray.
    Wrapper around maybe_convert_platform that alters the default return
    dtype in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.  For example,
    empty lists return with integer dtype instead of object dtype, which is
    prohibited for IntervalArray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array-like

    Returns
    -------
    array
    """
    if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) == 0:
        # GH 19016
        # empty lists/tuples get object dtype by default, but this is not
        # prohibited for IntervalArray, so coerce to integer instead
        return np.array([], dtype=np.int64)
    elif not is_categorical_dtype(values):
        values = np.asarray(values)

    return maybe_convert_platform(values)
The code seems to have a bug. The condition in the first if statement is using the `or` operator instead of `and`, which will always be True if `values` is a non-empty list or tuple. To properly check if `values` is an empty list or tuple, the condition should be `isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) == 0`.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that the condition for checking whether the input values are categorical or not is negated. It should be checking whether the input values are categorical, but the code is currently checking whether the input values are not categorical. This means that the values will not be converted to a NumPy array if they are categorical, which is incorrect according to the task description. To fix the bug, the `not` keyword should be removed from the condition, so that the code checks whether the input values are categorical as intended.
