Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The function maybe_convert_platform_interval takes an array-like object values as input and applies platform conversion to it, with special handling for IntervalArray. The function is essentially a wrapper around the function maybe_convert_platform, which does the actual platform conversion. The purpose of maybe_convert_platform_interval is to alter the default return dtype of maybe_convert_platform in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.

Specifically, if values is an empty list or tuple, the function returns an empty NumPy array of dtype np.int64, rather than the default object dtype. This is because object dtype is not allowed for IntervalArray.

If values is a categorical data type, it is converted to a NumPy array using np.asarray before being passed to maybe_convert_platform.

Overall, maybe_convert_platform_interval is a utility function that provides a convenient way to apply platform conversion to arrays, with special handling for certain cases.
Code:
def maybe_convert_platform_interval(values):
    """
    Try to do platform conversion, with special casing for IntervalArray.
    Wrapper around maybe_convert_platform that alters the default return
    dtype in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.  For example,
    empty lists return with integer dtype instead of object dtype, which is
    prohibited for IntervalArray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array-like

    Returns
    -------
    array
    """
    if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) or len(values) == 0:
        # GH 19016
        # empty lists/tuples get object dtype by default, but this is not
        # prohibited for IntervalArray, so coerce to integer instead
        return np.array([], dtype=np.int64)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(values):
        values = np.asarray(values)

    return maybe_convert_platform(values)
The code seems to have a bug. The condition `len(values) < 0` in the first if statement should be changed to `len(values) == 0`. As it is, the condition will never be true, and the function will not return an empty array of dtype np.int64 for empty lists or tuples, which is the intended behavior. The corrected code should be as follows:

```
def maybe_convert_platform_interval(values):
    """
    Try to do platform conversion, with special casing for IntervalArray.
    Wrapper around maybe_convert_platform that alters the default return
    dtype in certain cases to be compatible with IntervalArray.  For example,
    empty lists return with integer dtype instead of object dtype, which is
    prohibited for IntervalArray.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array-like

    Returns
    -------
    array
    """
    if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) == 0:
        # GH 19016
        # empty lists/tuples get object dtype by default, but this is not
        # prohibited for IntervalArray, so coerce to integer instead
        return np.array([], dtype=np.int64)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(values):
        values = np.asarray(values)

    return maybe_convert_platform(values)
```
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the if statement that checks if values is an empty list or tuple. Currently, it checks if the length of values is less than 0, which will always evaluate to False, since the length of any list or tuple is non-negative. It should instead check if the length of values is equal to 0, like this:

```
if isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) == 0:
    # code to handle empty list or tuple
```

By fixing this condition, the function will correctly handle empty lists and tuples as intended.
