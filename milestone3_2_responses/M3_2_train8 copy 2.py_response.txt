Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function that takes an image (as a NumPy array) and finds the locations of human faces in the image. The function has three parameters:

img: The input image.
number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image to look for smaller faces.
model: Which face detection model to use. The default is "hog", which is less accurate but faster on CPUs. If set to "cnn", a more accurate deep-learning model will be used, which requires GPU/CUDA acceleration.
The function first checks the value of model. If it is "cnn", the _raw_face_locations() function is called with the img, number_of_times_to_upsample, and "cnn" parameters to find the face locations in the image. For each detected face, the _rect_to_css() function is called to convert the face location from rectangle format to css format. Then, the _trim_css_to_bounds() function is called to trim the face location to be within the bounds of the input image. Finally, the trimmed face location is appended to a list and the list is returned.

If model is not "cnn", the same process is followed, except that the _rect_to_css() function is called with the face location directly instead of calling .rect attribute.
Code:
def face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample=1, model="hog"):
    """
    Returns an array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image

    :param img: An image (as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param model: Which face detection model to use. "hog" is less accurate but faster on CPUs. "cnn" is a more accurate
                  deep-learning model which is GPU/CUDA accelerated (if available). The default is "hog".
    :return: A list of tuples of found face locations in css (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    if model != "cnn":
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, "cnn")]
    else:
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, model)]The code is buggy. When model is not "cnn", the code should call _raw_face_locations() function with model parameter set to "hog" instead of "cnn". The current code has it set to "cnn" all the time.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
There seems to be a typo in the function. In the first return statement, the `_raw_face_locations` function is called with the third parameter set to `"cnn"`, regardless of the value of the `model` parameter. It should be `model` instead of `"cnn"`. The correct code should be:

```
return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), img.shape) for face in _raw_face_locations(img, number_of_times_to_upsample, model)]
```
