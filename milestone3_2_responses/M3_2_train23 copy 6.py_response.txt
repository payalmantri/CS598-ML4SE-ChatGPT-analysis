Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code defines a function called is_file_like that checks whether the given object has file-like properties or not. File-like objects are those that behave like files, which means they are iterable and have either a read and/or write method as an attribute.

The function first checks if the given object has a read or write attribute using the hasattr function. If it does not have any of these attributes, then it returns False.

Next, the function checks if the given object is iterable or not by checking whether it has an __iter__ attribute. If it does not have this attribute, then it returns False.

If the object has both read or write attribute and __iter__ attribute, the function returns True, indicating that the object is file-like.

The function includes a docstring explaining the purpose and behavior of the function. It also provides an example usage of the function by checking if an object created from the StringIO module is file-like or not.
Code:
def is_file_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a file-like object.

    For objects to be considered file-like, they must
    be an iterator AND have either a `read` and/or `write`
    method as an attribute.

    Note: file-like objects must be iterable, but
    iterable objects need not be file-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_file_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has file-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> buffer(StringIO("data"))
    >>> is_file_like(buffer)
    True
    >>> is_file_like([1, 2, 3])
    False
    """

    if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or hasattr(obj, 'write')):
        return False

    if not hasattr(obj, "__iter__"):
        return False

    return False
The code is buggy. All of the return statements return False, which is not the expected output. The first return statement should return False instead of True to correctly check if the object has read or write attribute. The last return statement should return True to indicate that the object has both read or write attribute and __iter__ attribute, indicating that the object is file-like. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def is_file_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a file-like object.

    For objects to be considered file-like, they must
    be an iterator AND have either a `read` and/or `write`
    method as an attribute.

    Note: file-like objects must be iterable, but
    iterable objects need not be file-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_file_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has file-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> buffer(StringIO("data"))
    >>> is_file_like(buffer)
    True
    >>> is_file_like([1, 2, 3])
    False
    """

    if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or hasattr(obj, 'write')):
        return False

    if not hasattr(obj, "__iter__"):
        return False

    return True
```
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that it is always returning False at the end, even when the object has both the read/write attribute and the __iter__ attribute, which should make it file-like. This means that the function will always return False, even for objects that are file-like, which is incorrect. 

The last return statement should be changed to return True, indicating that the object is file-like.
