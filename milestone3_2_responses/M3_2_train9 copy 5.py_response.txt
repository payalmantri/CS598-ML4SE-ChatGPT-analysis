Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This function takes a list of images (in the form of numpy arrays) and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect human faces in each image. The number_of_times_to_upsample parameter determines how many times to upsample each image to detect smaller faces. The batch_size parameter determines the number of images to process at once, which can be more efficient when using a GPU.

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the detected face locations in CSS (top, right, bottom, left) order for each image in the input list. The convert_cnn_detections_to_css function is an internal helper function that converts the CNN detections to CSS format.
Code:
def batch_face_locations(images, number_of_times_to_upsample=1, batch_size=128):
    """
    Returns an 2d array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image using the cnn face detector
    If you are using a GPU, this can give you much faster results since the GPU
    can process batches of images at once. If you aren't using a GPU, you don't need this function.

    :param img: A list of images (each as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param batch_size: How many images to include in each GPU processing batch.
    :return: A list of tuples of found face locations in css (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    def convert_cnn_detections_to_css(detections):
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), images[1].shape) for face in detections]

    raw_detections_batched = _raw_face_locations_batched(images, number_of_times_to_upsample, batch_size)

    return list(map(convert_cnn_detections_to_css, raw_detections_batched))There seems to be a bug in the code. 

In the `convert_cnn_detections_to_css` function, it tries to access the second element of the `images` list using `images[1].shape`. However, it should be accessing the shape of the current image being processed in the loop, which is represented by the `detections` variable.

To fix the bug, we should replace `images[1].shape` with `detections[0].image.shape` or just `detections[0].image_size`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def batch_face_locations(images, number_of_times_to_upsample=1, batch_size=128):
    """
    Returns an 2d array of bounding boxes of human faces in a image using the cnn face detector
    If you are using a GPU, this can give you much faster results since the GPU
    can process batches of images at once. If you aren't using a GPU, you don't need this function.

    :param img: A list of images (each as a numpy array)
    :param number_of_times_to_upsample: How many times to upsample the image looking for faces. Higher numbers find smaller faces.
    :param batch_size: How many images to include in each GPU processing batch.
    :return: A list of tuples of found face locations in css (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    def convert_cnn_detections_to_css(detections):
        return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), detections[0].image_size) for face in detections]

    raw_detections_batched = _raw_face_locations_batched(images, number_of_times_to_upsample, batch_size)

    return list(map(convert_cnn_detections_to_css, raw_detections_batched))
```
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the `convert_cnn_detections_to_css` function. Specifically, in the line that reads `return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), images[1].shape) for face in detections]`. The `images` list should be indexed using `0` instead of `1`, since the input images are stored at the beginning of the list. So the line should be changed to `return [_trim_css_to_bounds(_rect_to_css(face.rect), images[0].shape) for face in detections]`.
