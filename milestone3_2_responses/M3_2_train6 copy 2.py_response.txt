Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
def load_image_file(file, mode='RGB'):
    """
    Loads an image file (.jpg, .png, etc) into a numpy array

    :param file: image file name or file object to load
    :param mode: format to convert the image to. Only 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and 'L' (black and white) are supported.
    :return: image contents as numpy array
    """
    im = PIL.Image.open(file)
    if mode:
        im = im.convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)

    im = PIL.Image.open(file).convert(mode)
    return np.array(im)The original code is buggy. The condition in the if statement should be negated (`if not mode`) to check if `mode` is not None. As written, the code will skip the conversion step if `mode` is truthy, which includes valid mode strings.

The ChatGPT generated code looks correct and adds an additional input validation check by raising a `ValueError` if an invalid mode string is provided. This will help catch errors earlier and provide more informative error messages.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The original code seems to be correct, but the modified code has a bug. In the modified code, the condition for checking the mode is incorrect. It should be "if mode:", not "if not mode:". Additionally, the condition in the modified code is redundant since the original code already checks for the mode's validity, and raises an error if it is not supported. Therefore, the modified code unnecessarily duplicates this check.
