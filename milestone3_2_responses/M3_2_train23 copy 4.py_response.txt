Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code defines a function called is_file_like that checks whether the given object has file-like properties or not. File-like objects are those that behave like files, which means they are iterable and have either a read and/or write method as an attribute.

The function first checks if the given object has a read or write attribute using the hasattr function. If it does not have any of these attributes, then it returns False.

Next, the function checks if the given object is iterable or not by checking whether it has an __iter__ attribute. If it does not have this attribute, then it returns False.

If the object has both read or write attribute and __iter__ attribute, the function returns True, indicating that the object is file-like.

The function includes a docstring explaining the purpose and behavior of the function. It also provides an example usage of the function by checking if an object created from the StringIO module is file-like or not.
Code:
def is_file_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a file-like object.

    For objects to be considered file-like, they must
    be an iterator AND have either a `read` and/or `write`
    method as an attribute.

    Note: file-like objects must be iterable, but
    iterable objects need not be file-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_file_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has file-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> buffer(StringIO("data"))
    >>> is_file_like(buffer)
    True
    >>> is_file_like([1, 2, 3])
    False

    if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or not hasattr(obj, 'write')):
        return False

    if not hasattr(obj, "__iter__"):
        return False

    return True
The given code is buggy. The condition in the first if statement is incorrect. It should be checking if the object has either a `read` or `write` attribute, but the `not` operator is mistakenly applied to the `hasattr(obj, 'write')` part of the condition. This means that the function will return False if the object has a `write` attribute, even if it also has a `read` attribute. 

To fix the code, the `not` operator should be removed from the second part of the condition. The correct code for the first if statement is:

```
if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or hasattr(obj, 'write')):
    return False
```
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the following line:

```
if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or not hasattr(obj, 'write')):
```

The logic of the condition is incorrect. The `not` before `hasattr(obj, 'write')` should not be there. The correct code should be:

```
if not (hasattr(obj, 'read') or hasattr(obj, 'write')):
```

This will correctly check if the object has either a `read` or `write` attribute.
