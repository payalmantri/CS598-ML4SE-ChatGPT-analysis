Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function called is_sequence() that takes an object as input and checks whether it is a sequence of objects. The function first checks whether the input object is iterable (i.e., it can be looped over) and has a length associated with it using the iter() and len() functions respectively. If these conditions are met, the function then checks whether the input object is a string or bytes using the isinstance() function. If the input object satisfies all these conditions, the function returns True, indicating that the object is a sequence of objects. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function also includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples of how to use it.
Code:
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        len(obj)   # Has a length associated with it.
        return not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except (AttributeError):
        return False
The code is almost correct, but there is a small bug. The `len()` function is not being used correctly. Instead of checking the length of `obj` by calling `len(obj)`, the function is actually calling the `len()` function without assigning its result to a variable or using it in any way. To fix the bug, the line `len(obj)` should be changed to `_ = len(obj)`. This will correctly check the length of `obj` and assign the result to the dummy variable `_`.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The code seems to be buggy because the `len()` function is called without assigning its return value to a variable, which means it does not actually check if the object has a length associated with it. The `try-except` block should be modified to catch the `TypeError` exception that is raised when an object is not iterable, rather than checking for `AttributeError`. Also, the function should check whether the object is a sequence of objects, and not just any iterable object. Finally, the examples provided should be modified to reflect the correct behavior of the function.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        if isinstance(obj, (str, bytes)):
            return False
        else:
            return True
    except (TypeError):
        return False
```
