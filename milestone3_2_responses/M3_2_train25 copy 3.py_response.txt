Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This function checks whether an object is "list-like", meaning it is a list or an object that can be treated like a list (e.g. a tuple). It also checks that all elements of the list (if it is a list) are themselves "list-like".

The function first checks whether the object is list-like using the is_list_like() function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided, but likely checks whether the object is a list, tuple, or other sequence type. If the object is list-like, the function then checks whether it has a length (using the hasattr() function) and whether that length is greater than 0. Finally, the function uses a generator expression and the all() function to check whether all elements of the object (if it is a list) are also list-like.

The function returns True if the object is list-like and all of its elements (if it is a list) are also list-like, and False otherwise.

The function also includes some additional notes and examples in its docstring, as well as a reference to another related function (is_list_like()).
Code:
def is_nested_list_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is list-like, and that all of its elements
    are also list-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_list_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has list-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3]])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like([{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like(["foo"])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3], 1])
    False

    Notes
    -----
    This won't reliably detect whether a consumable iterator (e. g.
    a generator) is a nested-list-like without consuming the iterator.
    To avoid consuming it, we always return False if the outer container
    doesn't define `__len__`.

            len(obj) > 0 and all(is_list_like(item) for item in obj))
The code is buggy. 

The return statement should be checking if the object is list-like and if all its elements are list-like. However, the current implementation is checking if the object is not list-like, if it has a length greater than 0, and if all its elements are list-like.

To fix the bug, the condition in the return statement should be changed to `(is_list_like(obj) and all(is_list_like(item) for item in obj))`. This will correctly check if the object is list-like and if all its elements are also list-like.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is with the condition in the return statement. Specifically, the code is using the `not` operator before the condition `is_list_like(obj)` which is incorrect. It should be `not is_list_like(obj)` instead. This means that the code is returning `True` only if `obj` is not list-like, and all other conditions are satisfied, which is the opposite of what the code is supposed to do.
