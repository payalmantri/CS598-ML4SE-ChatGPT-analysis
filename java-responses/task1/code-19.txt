 Prompt:        private static boolean polygonTouchesPoint_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Point point_b, double tolerance, ProgressTracker progress_tracker) {
                Point2D pt_b = point_b.getXY();
                return polygonTouchesPointImpl_(polygon_a, pt_b, tolerance, null);
        }

What is this method doing
Code:
        private static boolean polygonTouchesPoint_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Point point_b, double tolerance, ProgressTracker progress_tracker) {
                Point2D pt_b = point_b.getXY();
                return polygonTouchesPointImpl_(polygon_a, pt_b, tolerance, null);
        }

-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: The polygonTouchesPoint_ method takes a Polygon object polygon_a, a Point object point_b, a tolerance value tolerance, and a ProgressTracker object progress_tracker.

The method first converts the Point object point_b to a Point2D object pt_b that contains its x and y coordinates. Then, the method calls the polygonTouchesPointImpl_ method with the Polygon object polygon_a, the Point2D object pt_b, the tolerance value tolerance, and a null value for the ProgressTracker object.

The polygonTouchesPointImpl_ method is expected to return a boolean value indicating whether the Polygon object polygon_a touches the point pt_b within the given tolerance. The polygonTouchesPoint_ method simply returns the value returned by polygonTouchesPointImpl_.

In summary, the polygonTouchesPoint_ method is a simple wrapper method that calls another method to determine whether a polygon touches a point within a given tolerance
