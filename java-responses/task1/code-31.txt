 Prompt: What does the following code do
    public static void copyFile(File from, File to) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(from));
        try {
            OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(to));
            try {
                IoUtils.copyAllBytes(in, out);
            } finally {
                IoUtils.safeClose(out);
            }
        } finally {
            IoUtils.safeClose(in);
        }
    }

ChatGPT response: The given Java code defines a method copyFile that takes two File objects as input, representing the source file (from) and the destination file (to). The purpose of this method is to copy the contents of the source file to the destination file.

Here's how the code works:

It creates an InputStream object by wrapping a FileInputStream object around the source file. The InputStream is then wrapped in a BufferedInputStream object to improve performance.

An OutputStream object is created by wrapping a FileOutputStream object around the destination file. The OutputStream is then wrapped in a BufferedOutputStream object to improve performance.

The IoUtils.copyAllBytes method is then called to copy the bytes from the input stream to the output stream.

After the copying is completed, the output stream is closed by calling IoUtils.safeClose(out), which ensures that any resources associated with the output stream are released properly.

Finally, the input stream is closed by calling IoUtils.safeClose(in), which ensures that any resources associated with the input stream are released properly.

If an error occurs during the copying process, an IOException is thrown, which is why the method signature includes throws IOException.
