 Prompt: What does the code do 
Code:
        // Returns true if polygon_a is disjoint from point_b.
        private static boolean polygonDisjointPoint_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Point point_b, double tolerance, ProgressTracker progress_tracker) {
                PolygonUtils.PiPResult result = PolygonUtils.isPointInPolygon2D(
                                polygon_a, point_b, tolerance);

                if (result == PolygonUtils.PiPResult.PiPOutside)
                        return true;

                return false;
        }

ChatGPT response: The given code defines a static method polygonDisjointPoint_ that takes four input parameters:

A Polygon object polygon_a: This represents a polygon defined by a sequence of vertices.
A Point object point_b: This represents a point in 2D space.
A double value tolerance: This represents the maximum distance allowed between the point and the edges of the polygon before it is considered to intersect.
A ProgressTracker object progress_tracker: This is an optional object that can be used to track the progress of the computation.
The method uses the PolygonUtils.isPointInPolygon2D method to check if the given point point_b lies inside the polygon polygon_a or not, with a given tolerance value. This method returns a PolygonUtils.PiPResult enum value which can be either PiPResult.PiPInside if the point is inside the polygon, PiPResult.PiPBoundary if the point is on the boundary of the polygon, or PiPResult.PiPOutside if the point is outside the polygon.

If the result of the check is PiPOutside, which means the point is outside the polygon, the function returns true, indicating that the polygon is disjoint from the point. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the polygon intersects with the point
