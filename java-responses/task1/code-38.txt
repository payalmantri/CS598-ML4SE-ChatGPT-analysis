 Prompt: What does below code do
"@CommandArgument
  public void load(
      @OptionArgument(""filename"") String filename) {

    users.clear();

    try {
      BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));

      while (reader.ready()) {
        User user = User.fromString(reader.readLine());
        users.put(user.username, user);
      }
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      System.err.println(String.format(""File not found: '%s'"", filename));
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }"
Code:
@CommandArgument
  public void load(
      @OptionArgument("filename") String filename) {

    users.clear();

    try {
      BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));

      while (reader.ready()) {
        User user = User.fromString(reader.readLine());
        users.put(user.username, user);
      }
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      System.err.println(String.format("File not found: '%s'", filename));
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }

ChatGPT response: This code defines a method named "load" that takes a single argument "filename". The method is annotated with "@CommandArgument", which suggests that this method is part of a command-line tool and can be called using command-line arguments.

The argument "filename" is annotated with "@OptionArgument", which means that it is an optional argument that can be passed using a command-line option. The option is expected to have a name "filename".

The method first clears a collection named "users". It then tries to read a file with the given filename using a BufferedReader. The method reads each line of the file and converts it into a User object using the static method "fromString" of the User class. The User object is then added to the "users" collection using the username as the key.

If the file is not found, the method prints an error message. If an IOException occurs during reading the file, it is printed to the console using the "printStackTrace" method.

In summary, this method reads a file containing User objects and populates a collection with the parsed User objects. The method can be called using a command-line option "filename" to specify the name of the input file.
