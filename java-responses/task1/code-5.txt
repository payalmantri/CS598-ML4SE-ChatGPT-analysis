 Prompt: What happens if prev is not -1
Code:
	int removeGeometry(int geometry) {
		for (int path = getFirstPath(geometry); path != -1; path = removePath(path)) {
			// removing paths in a loop
		}

		int prev = getPrevGeometry(geometry);

-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: If prev is not -1, it means that the geometry being removed has a previous geometry in the collection. In that case, the "next" reference of the previous geometry is updated to point to the geometry following the one being removed (next).

This is accomplished by calling setNextGeometry_ with arguments prev and next, which presumably updates the "next" reference of the geometry with the index prev to point to the geometry with the index next.

Essentially, this updates the reference of the previous geometry to skip over the geometry being removed, so that the linked list of geometries remains intact after the removal.
