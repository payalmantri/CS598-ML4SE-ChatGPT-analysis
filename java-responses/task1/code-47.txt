 Prompt: What does this code snippet do 
  public static String getExtension(String fileName) {
    int pos = fileName.lastIndexOf('.');
    if (pos < 0) {
      return "";
    }
    return fileName.substring(pos + 1);
  }
Code:


-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: This code snippet is a Java method named "getExtension" that takes a String parameter "fileName". The purpose of this method is to extract the file extension from the given file name.

Here's what the code does:

First, it finds the position of the last occurrence of the '.' character in the fileName string using the "lastIndexOf" method.
If the '.' character is not found in the fileName string, then the method returns an empty string ("").
If the '.' character is found, then the method uses the "substring" method to return the characters that come after the '.' character. This substring represents the file extension.
So, in summary, the method extracts the file extension from the given file name and returns it as a String. For example, if the input file name is "example.txt", the method will return "txt".

 Prompt: if  input = abc.abco.ir.org 
Code:
  public static String getExtension(String fileName) {
    int pos = fileName.lastIndexOf('.');
    if (pos < 0) {
      return "";
    }
    return fileName.substring(pos + 1);
  }

-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: If the input is "abc.abco.ir.org", and we call the "getExtension" method with this input as an argument, the method will return "org".

Here's how the method works:

The "lastIndexOf" method will find the last occurrence of the '.' character in the input string, which is between "ir" and "org".
The "substring" method will extract the characters that come after the '.' character, which is "org".
The method then returns "org" as the file extension.
