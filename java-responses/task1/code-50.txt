 Prompt: What does the code do
Code:
  public static int update(Connection con, String query, Object... param) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement stmt = null;
    try {
      stmt = con.prepareStatement(query);
      for (int i = 0; i < param.length; i++) {
        stmt.setObject(i + 1, param[i]);
      }
      return stmt.executeUpdate();
    } finally {
      close(stmt);
    }
  }

ChatGPT response: This is a Java method named update that takes a java.sql.Connection object, a String query, and a variable number of parameters as input, and returns an integer value indicating the number of rows affected by the SQL statement.

The method executes a SQL query by creating a PreparedStatement object with the query parameter, and sets the values of the parameters in the SQL statement using the setObject method of the PreparedStatement object. The parameter values are passed as a variable argument list using the ... syntax.

The executeUpdate method of the PreparedStatement object is then called to execute the SQL statement and return the number of rows affected.

Finally, the PreparedStatement object is closed using the close method, which is a private method that likely takes care of closing the statement and freeing any associated resources.

If any SQLException occurs during the execution of the method, it is thrown to the calling code.
