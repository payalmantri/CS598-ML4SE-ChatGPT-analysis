ChatGPT response: he startAddingEdges() method appears to be part of a graph or computational geometry algorithm that involves adding edges to a data structure. Here's what the code does:

It first checks if there are any edges in the data structure by checking if the numEdges_ variable is greater than 0. If there are no edges, the method does nothing.
If there are edges, the method loops through each y-coordinate (i.e., height) of the edges in the ySortedEdges_ array.
For each y-coordinate, it sets the next field of each edge in the linked list to null, effectively removing the edges from the linked list.
It then sets the ySortedEdges_ array for that y-coordinate to null, effectively removing all the edges from the data structure for that y-coordinate.
Finally, it sets activeEdgesTable_ to null and resets minY_, maxY_, and numEdges_ variables to their initial values.
In summary, this method appears to clear the edges that have been added to the data structure, resetting it to its initial state so that new edges can be added again.
