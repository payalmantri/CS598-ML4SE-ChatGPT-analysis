ChatGPT response: Here's an alternative implementation of the hasPointFeatures() method that achieves the same result:

arduino
Copy code
boolean hasPointFeatures() {
    for (int i = 0; i < getGeometryCount(); i++) {
        if (getGeometry(i).getType() != Geometry.Type.MULTIPOINT) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
This implementation works as follows:

The hasPointFeatures() method is called.
A for loop is used to iterate over each geometry in the Geometry object.
The getGeometryType() method is replaced with getGeometry(i).getType(), which returns the type of the current geometry in the loop.
The if statement checks if the current geometry is not a MULTIPOINT type, using the != operator instead of the !Geometry.isMultiPath() method.
If a geometry is found that is not a MULTIPOINT type, true is returned from the method.
If no geometries are found that are not a MULTIPOINT type, false is returned from the method.
This implementation is semantically equivalent to the original code and produces the same output. It achieves the same result by using an alternative approach to iterating over the geometries and checking their type.
