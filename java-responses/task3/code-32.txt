ChatGPT response: Sure, here's an alternative implementation for the copyAllBytes method:

csharp
Copy code
public static long copyAllBytes(InputStream in, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    return in.transferTo(out);
}
Explanation:

This implementation uses the transferTo method provided by the InputStream class to copy the contents of one stream to another.

The transferTo method is used to perform the copying operation. This method takes one argument: the destination output stream to write the data to.

The method returns the number of bytes transferred, which is equivalent to the total number of bytes read from the input stream.

Note that the return type is changed from int to long to accommodate the fact that transferTo returns a long value representing the number of bytes transferred.
