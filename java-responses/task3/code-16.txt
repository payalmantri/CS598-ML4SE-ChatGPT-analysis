 Prompt: write semantically equivalent code for this method
Code:
        // Returns true if polygon_a overlaps polygon_b.
        private static boolean polygonOverlapsPolygon_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Polygon polygon_b, double tolerance,

                // Quick rasterize test to see whether the the geometries are disjoint,
                // or if one is contained in the other.

ChatGPT response: Here is an example of semantically equivalent code for the polygonOverlapsPolygon_() method:
private static boolean polygonOverlapsPolygon(Polygon polygon1, Polygon polygon2, double tolerance, ProgressTracker progressTracker) {
    boolean overlap = false;
    boolean disjoint = false;
    boolean contained = false;

    // Compare all pairs of line segments between the two polygons
    for (int i = 0; i < polygon1.npoints; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < polygon2.npoints; j++) {
            double dist = distanceBetweenLineSegments(polygon1.xpoints[i], polygon1.ypoints[i],
                                                       polygon1.xpoints[(i + 1) % polygon1.npoints], polygon1.ypoints[(i + 1) % polygon1.npoints],
                                                       polygon2.xpoints[j], polygon2.ypoints[j],
                                                       polygon2.xpoints[(j + 1) % polygon2.npoints], polygon2.ypoints[(j + 1) % polygon2.npoints]);

            if (dist < tolerance) {
                overlap = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (overlap) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!overlap) {
        // If the polygons do not overlap, check if one polygon is contained within the other
        if (polygon1.contains(polygon2.getBounds()) || polygon2.contains(polygon1.getBounds())) {
            contained = true;
        } else {
            disjoint = true;
        }
    }

    return !(disjoint || contained);
}

// Helper method to calculate the distance between two line segments
private static double distanceBetweenLineSegments(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3, double x4, double y4) {
    double dx1 = x2 - x1;
    double dy1 = y2 - y1;
    double dx2 = x4 - x3;
    double dy2 = y4 - y3;
    double dx3 = x1 - x3;
    double dy3 = y1 - y3;

    double denom = dy2 * dx1 - dx2 * dy1;

    if (denom == 0.0) {
        return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    }

    double ua = (dx2 * dy3 - dy2 * dx3) / denom;
    double ub = (dx1 * dy3 - dy1 * dx3) / denom;

    if (ua < 0.0 || ua > 1.0 || ub < 0.0 || ub > 1.0) {
        return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    }

    double intersectionX = x1 + ua * dx1;
    double intersectionY = y1 + ua * dy1;

    return Math.sqrt((intersectionX - x3) * (intersectionX - x3) + (intersectionY - y3) * (intersectionY - y3));
}
This code takes the same four parameters as the original method and checks if the two polygons overlap or are disjoint using a different approach. Instead of using a rasterize test, it loops through all pairs of line segments between the two polygons and calculates the distance between them. If the distance is less than the given tolerance, the method considers the polygons to overlap.

If the polygons do not overlap, the method checks if one polygon is contained within the other using the contains() method of the Polygon class. If one polygon is contained within the other, the method sets the contained flag to true. Otherwise, it sets the disjoint flag to true.

Finally, the method returns tru
