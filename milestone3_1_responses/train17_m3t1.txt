What does the following code do? 
The `_create_converter` function creates a converter function that can be used to drop the names of fields in an object. 

The `converter_helper` function recursively creates a nested converter function based on the provided `dataType` argument. If the data type does not require any conversion, the converter function simply returns the input object. 

If the data type is an `ArrayType` or `MapType`, the converter function is created recursively using the element type or key and value types, respectively. The converter function for an array applies the converter function to each element in the array. The converter function for a map applies the converter function to each key and value in the map and returns a new dictionary with the converted keys and values.

If the data type is a `NullType`, the converter function returns `None`.

If the data type is a `StructType`, the converter function creates a tuple of values for each field in the struct. If the input object is a tuple or list, the converter function applies the corresponding converter function to each value in the tuple/list. If the input object is a dictionary or object with a `__dict__` attribute, the converter function creates a tuple of values by extracting each field from the dictionary or object and applying the corresponding converter function. 

The `_create_converter` function returns the converter function created by the `converter_helper` function with the provided `dataType` argument.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code and the following code are equivalent. The only difference is that the first implementation uses a nested function (`converter_helper`) to implement the recursive logic, while the second implementation implements the same logic using if-else statements and calls the same function recursively. However, both implementations will produce the same result for the same input.
