What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `_has_nulltype` that takes a `dt` argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input type `dt` contains the `NullType` or not. 

The function works recursively by traversing the schema structure. If `dt` is a `StructType`, the function iterates over each field and recursively calls itself with the field's data type. If `dt` is an `ArrayType`, the function recursively calls itself with the element type. If `dt` is a `MapType`, the function recursively calls itself with both the key and value types. Finally, if `dt` is a `NullType`, the function returns `True`. 

The function returns `True` if any `NullType` is found during the traversal and returns `False` if no `NullType` is found.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code is equivalent to the following code.
