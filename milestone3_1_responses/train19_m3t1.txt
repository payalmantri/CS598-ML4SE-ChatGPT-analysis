What does the following code do? 
The code defines a function called `merge` that takes multiple sorted iterables (e.g., lists) and merges them into a single sorted iterable using the `heapq.merge` function. If the `key` argument is provided, it applies a key function to each element before sorting. The function returns a generator object that yields the sorted values one at a time, instead of pulling all the data into memory at once. The `get_next` function is a helper function used to retrieve the next element from an iterable.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two codes achieve the same purpose of merging multiple sorted input iterables into a single sorted output generator. However, the first code uses the built-in `merge` function from the `heapq` module to merge the iterables, while the second code implements a custom heap-based merge algorithm. Additionally, the first code supports an optional `key` parameter that allows for sorting elements based on a key function, while the second code always sorts elements based on their natural ordering.
