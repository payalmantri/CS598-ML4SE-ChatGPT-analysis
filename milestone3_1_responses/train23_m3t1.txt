What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `is_file_like` that checks if an object is a file-like object. A file-like object is an object that has a `read` and/or `write` method as an attribute. The function returns `True` if the object has either a `read` or `write` attribute, and `False` otherwise.

The function also notes that file-like objects must be iterable, but iterable objects need not be file-like. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has file-like properties. 

The function includes an example demonstrating how the `is_file_like` function can be used to check whether a `StringIO` object has file-like properties, which should return `True`. It also shows that a list object is not file-like and should return `False`.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. 

In the original code, an object is considered file-like if it has either a `read` or a `write` method. In contrast, in the modified code, an object is considered file-like if it is an iterator and has either a `read` or a `write` method. 

Additionally, in the modified code, if the object does not have either a `read` or a `write` method, or if it is not an iterator, it is immediately deemed not file-like and `False` is returned. However, in the original code, the check is combined into a single `return` statement, where `False` is returned if neither `hasattr(obj, 'read')` nor `hasattr(obj, 'write')` evaluates to `True`.
