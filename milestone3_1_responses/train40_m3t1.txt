What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `get_transforms` that returns a list of data augmentation transformations that can be applied to an image during training of a computer vision model. 

The function takes several input parameters:

- `do_flip`: a boolean indicating whether or not to include a horizontal flip transformation in the list.
- `flip_vert`: a boolean indicating whether or not to include a vertical flip transformation in the list.
- `max_rotate`: a float indicating the maximum rotation angle (in degrees) for a rotation transformation to be included in the list.
- `max_zoom`: a float indicating the maximum zoom scale for a zoom transformation to be included in the list.
- `max_lighting`: a float indicating the maximum brightness/contrast adjustment for a lighting transformation to be included in the list.
- `max_warp`: a float indicating the maximum warp magnitude for a symmetric warp transformation to be included in the list.
- `p_affine`: a float indicating the probability that an affine transformation (e.g., rotation, zoom, warp) will be applied to an image.
- `p_lighting`: a float indicating the probability that a lighting transformation (e.g., brightness, contrast) will be applied to an image.
- `xtra_tfms`: an optional list of additional transformations to be included in the list.

The function then constructs a list of transformation objects, starting with a random crop transformation (`rand_crop()`). If `do_flip` is True, the list includes a horizontal flip (`flip_lr(p=0.5)`) or a dihedral affine (`dihedral_affine()`) depending on the value of `flip_vert`. If `max_warp` is non-zero, the list includes a symmetric warp transformation (`symmetric_warp()`) with a magnitude ranging from `-max_warp` to `max_warp`. If `max_rotate` is non-zero, the list includes a rotation transformation (`rotate()`) with an angle ranging from `-max_rotate` to `max_rotate`. If `max_zoom` is greater than 1, the list includes a random zoom transformation (`rand_zoom()`) with a scale ranging from 1 to `max_zoom`. If `max_lighting` is non-zero, the list includes a brightness transformation (`brightness()`) with a change ranging from `0.5*(1-max_lighting)` to `0.5*(1+max_lighting)` and a contrast transformation (`contrast()`) with a scale ranging from `1-max_lighting` to `1/(1-max_lighting)`. Finally, the function returns the list of transformations concatenated with any additional transformations specified in `xtra_tfms`, as well as a second list containing only a crop padding transformation (`crop_pad()`), to be applied to validation data.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. The first code applies a crop and a set of transformations to the training set, and applies a crop and a padding transformation to the validation set. The second code applies the same set of transformations to both the training and validation sets.
