What does the following code do? 
The `nsmallest` function takes three parameters: `n`, `iterable`, and `key`. It finds the `n` smallest elements in the `iterable`, using the `key` function to determine the order. If `key` is not provided, it defaults to the identity function.

The function creates a heap using the `heapq` module and then iterates over the `iterable`. For each element in the `iterable`, the `key` function is applied to the element, and the result along with the element is pushed onto the heap. If the length of the heap is greater than `n`, the smallest element is popped from the heap. Once all elements have been processed, the remaining elements in the heap are sorted by their keys and returned as a list.

The function is equivalent to calling `sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n]`, but the heap-based implementation can be more efficient for large datasets when `n` is much smaller than the length of the `iterable`.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the above code is not equivalent to the previous code. The second implementation of `nsmallest()` is more complex and includes additional logic to handle edge cases and optimize performance in certain scenarios, whereas the first implementation is a more direct and simple implementation of the algorithm. The second implementation also includes a separate implementation for the special case of `n=1`, which is not present in the first implementation.
