What does the following code do? 
The `hist_frame` function creates a histogram plot of a pandas DataFrame or a Series. 

If `by` is provided, it groups the data by the column(s) specified and creates a histogram plot for each group.

If `column` is provided, it selects the specified column(s) from the data and creates a histogram plot for each column.

The function also has various parameters for controlling the appearance of the plot, such as `grid`, `xlabelsize`, `xrot`, `ylabelsize`, `yrot`, `ax`, `sharex`, `sharey`, `figsize`, `layout`, `bins`, and `**kwds`. 

The function returns a list of Matplotlib axes objects representing the histograms.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the code you provided is equivalent to the original `hist_frame` function, with the only difference being that it is defined using the `def` keyword instead of the `@Appender` decorator.
