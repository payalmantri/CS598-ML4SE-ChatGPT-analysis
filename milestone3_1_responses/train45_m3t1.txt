What does the following code do? 
This is a method definition for a function called `get_layer_opt` that belongs to a class. This function returns an instance of the `LayerOptimizer` class. The `LayerOptimizer` class allows for setting differential learning rates and weight decays for different parts of a model. 

The function takes in two arguments:
- `lrs`: a float or list of floats representing the learning rate(s) for the model.
- `wds`: a float or list of floats representing the weight decay parameter(s).

The function returns an instance of the `LayerOptimizer` class initialized with the following parameters:
- `self.opt_fn`: the optimizer function to be used for training the model (presumably defined elsewhere in the class).
- `self.get_layer_groups()`: a method that returns a list of layer groups in the model.
- `lrs`: the learning rate(s) for the model.
- `wds`: the weight decay parameter(s).
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two code blocks are exactly the same. The second block of code is just a duplicate of the first block of code.
