What does the following code do? 
The code defines a function `_raw_face_locations` that uses OpenCV to detect human faces in an image. The function takes as input an image (as a numpy array), the number of times to upsample the image looking for faces, and the face detection model to use (either "hog" or "cnn"). The function converts a grayscale image to RGB and uses the selected face detection model to locate faces in the image. The function returns a list of dlib 'rect' objects representing the bounding boxes of the found faces, where each object contains the coordinates of the top, right, bottom, and left edges of the bounding box.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two functions are not equivalent. 

The original code performs an additional step of converting a grayscale image to RGB using OpenCV's `cvtColor` function if the input image is grayscale. The equivalent code does not have this step and assumes that the input image is already in RGB format.
