What does the following code do? 
The function `construct_1d_object_array_from_listlike` takes an iterable `values` and returns a 1-dimensional numpy array of dtype object containing the same values. It first checks if the length of the iterable can be determined using the `len()` function, raising a TypeError if it cannot. Then, it creates a new numpy array using `np.fromiter()` function, which converts an iterable to an array. The resulting array has the same length as the iterable and is of dtype 'object'. Finally, the array is returned.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
The two functions are similar in that they both create a 1-dimensional numpy array of object dtype from a list-like object. However, there are some differences in their implementation.

The first function uses `np.fromiter` to create the array directly from the iterable `values`. This function requires an iterable object and a count of the number of items to be added to the array. It is a fast and memory-efficient way to create arrays from iterable objects, but it has some limitations, such as not being able to handle nested iterables.

The second function creates an empty array with `np.empty` and then assigns the values from `values` to the array using slicing. This method is more flexible and can handle nested iterables, but it requires more memory since it first creates an empty array and then fills it.

In summary, while the two functions have similar behavior, they differ in their underlying implementation.
