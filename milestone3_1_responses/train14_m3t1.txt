What does the following code do? 
The given code is a function called `_infer_type` which infers the Spark `DataType` of the given object. 

If the object is None, it returns a `NullType`. If the object has a user-defined type (UDT), it returns the UDT. 
If the object's type is in the `_type_mappings` dictionary, it returns the corresponding Spark `DataType`. 
If the object is a dictionary, it infers the key and value types of the dictionary and returns a `MapType`. 
If the object is a list, it infers the element type of the list and returns an `ArrayType`. 
If the object is an array, it returns the corresponding Spark `ArrayType`. 
If the object is not any of these types, it tries to infer the schema of the object using the `_infer_schema` function, and returns the inferred schema as a `StructType`. If `_infer_schema` raises a TypeError, it raises a TypeError indicating that the object's type is not supported.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. 
In the first code, for a dictionary, 
    only the first non-null key-value pair is used to infer the data type for the map, 
    while in the second code, all the key-value pairs are checked to infer the data type. 
Similarly, in the first code, only the first non-null element in a list is used to infer the data type for the array, 
    while in the second code, all the elements are checked. 
These differences can result in different inferred data types for the same input object.
