What does the following code do? 
The function `_trim_css_to_bounds` takes in two arguments: 

1. `css`: A tuple of integers in the order `(top, right, bottom, left)` representing the CSS box of a rectangular region.
2. `image_shape`: A tuple of integers representing the shape of an image in the form `(height, width)`.

The function ensures that the CSS box represented by the input `css` is within the bounds of the image represented by `image_shape`. To do this, it first unpacks the `css` tuple into separate variables for `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. It then sets the maximum value of `top` to be the minimum of `top` and the height of the image (`image_shape[0]`), ensuring that `top` is within the bounds of the image's height. Similarly, it sets the maximum value of `right` to be the minimum of `right` and the width of the image (`image_shape[1]`), ensuring that `right` is within the bounds of the image's width. It sets the maximum value of `bottom` to be the maximum of `bottom` and 0, ensuring that `bottom` is within the bounds of the image's height from below. It sets the maximum value of `left` to be the maximum of `left` and 0, ensuring that `left` is within the bounds of the image's width from the left. Finally, it returns a new tuple of `(max_top, max_right, max_bottom, max_left)`, representing the trimmed CSS box within the bounds of the image.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code is equivalent to the previous code. It performs the same task of ensuring that a rectangle represented by a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image. The new code just uses the values from the input `css` tuple directly instead of assigning them to separate variables first.
