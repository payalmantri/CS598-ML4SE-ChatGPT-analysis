What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `is_list_like` that checks whether an object is list-like. List-like objects are defined as objects that have list-like properties such as being iterable, not being a string or bytes object, and not being a scalar ndarray. List-like objects may include Python lists, tuples, sets, NumPy arrays, and Pandas Series. The function takes an additional parameter `allow_sets` which is a boolean indicating whether sets should be considered list-like. If `allow_sets` is False, sets will not be considered list-like. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input object is list-like or not. The function includes some examples of input objects and their corresponding output values.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two codes are equivalent. The second code simplifies the conditional statements using boolean logic, but the output will be the same.
