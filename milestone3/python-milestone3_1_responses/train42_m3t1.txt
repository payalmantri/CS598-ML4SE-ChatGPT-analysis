What does the following code do? 
The given code defines a function `rand_resize_crop` that takes three arguments:
- `size` (required): an integer specifying the output size of the cropped image.
- `max_scale` (optional, default=2.0): a float specifying the maximum scaling factor to apply to the image before cropping.
- `ratios` (optional, default=(0.75,1.33)): a tuple of two floats specifying the range of aspect ratios that the cropped image can have.

The function returns a list of two image transformation functions: `zoom_squish` and `crop`. The `zoom_squish` function applies a random scaling and aspect ratio transformation to the image, where the scaling factor is randomly chosen between 1.0 and `max_scale`, and the aspect ratio is randomly chosen between the two ratios specified in the `ratios` tuple. The `crop` function then crops the transformed image to the specified `size`. 

Overall, the `rand_resize_crop` function can be used to apply a random resize and crop transformation to an input image, which can be useful for data augmentation in computer vision tasks.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
The code you have provided appears to be identical to the original code. Both functions return a list of two image transformation functions (`zoom_squish` and `crop`) that can be used to apply a random resize and crop transformation to an input image. 

Therefore, both functions should produce the same output when called with the same input arguments.
