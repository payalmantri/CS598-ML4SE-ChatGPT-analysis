What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `face_encodings` that takes an image as input and returns the 128-dimensional face encoding for each face in the image. 

If `known_face_locations` is provided, the function will use those locations to extract each face from the image and calculate its encoding. If `known_face_locations` is not provided, the function will use the `face_locations` function to locate the faces in the image. 

For each face in the image, the function first extracts the face image using the bounding box coordinates provided in `known_face_locations` or detected by `face_locations`. Then, the function uses the `_raw_face_landmarks` function with the "small" model to calculate the raw face landmarks of the cropped face image. Finally, the function uses the `face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor` function to calculate the face encoding for each face using the raw landmarks and the specified number of jitters. The function returns a list of the face encodings for each face in the image.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two codes are equivalent in terms of their functionality. The only difference is that the first code explicitly crops each face image based on the provided bounding box coordinates before computing the face encoding, while the second code computes the face encoding directly from the original image using the provided bounding box coordinates and then returns a list of encodings. The second code is likely more efficient because it avoids the extra step of cropping the face image.
