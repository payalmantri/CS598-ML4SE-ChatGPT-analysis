What does the following code do? 
The given code is a Python function that detects human faces in an image using either a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature-based classifier or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning-based classifier. The function takes an image as a NumPy array, the number of times to upsample the image (which increases the resolution of the image), and the model to use as input arguments. The function returns a list of tuples representing the location of each detected face in the image in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) format, which is in (top, right, bottom, left) order. The location of each face is represented by four values: the top pixel position, the right pixel position, the bottom pixel position, and the left pixel position.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the second code is equivalent to the first code. The second code uses list comprehension to achieve the same result as the for loop in the first code.
