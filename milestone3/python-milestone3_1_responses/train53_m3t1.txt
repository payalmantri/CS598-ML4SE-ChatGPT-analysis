What does the following code do? 
The above code applies Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and Temporal Activation Regularization (TAR) to the loss during the backward pass in training a neural network. 

ARD is a regularization technique that tries to automatically set the strength of regularization (weight decay) applied to each weight in a neural network, depending on how important the weight is. In this code, if the `alpha` parameter is non-zero, then the loss is modified by adding `alpha` times the mean of the square of the last output tensor (`self.out[-1]`) to the original loss (`last_loss`).

TAR is a regularization technique that encourages the activations in a neural network to be smooth across time. In this code, if the `beta` parameter is non-zero, then the loss is modified by adding `beta` times the mean of the square of the difference between adjacent time steps of the last raw output tensor (`self.raw_out[-1]`) to the original loss (`last_loss`). Note that the first dimension of `h` is assumed to be the batch size, and the second dimension represents the time steps.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two code snippets are equivalent. The only difference is the formatting of the code.
