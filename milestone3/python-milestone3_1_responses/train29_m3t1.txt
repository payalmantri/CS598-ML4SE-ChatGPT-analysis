What does the following code do? 
The `construct_1d_arraylike_from_scalar` function creates a one-dimensional NumPy array or a pandas Series/Index of specified length and dtype, filled with a specified scalar value. If the dtype is a pandas `DatetimeTZDtype` object, a pandas `DatetimeIndex` is created with the specified length and dtype, where all elements have the same value. If the dtype is a pandas `CategoricalDtype` object, a pandas `Categorical` object is created with the specified length and dtype, where all elements have the same value. Otherwise, a NumPy array is created using the `np.full()` function with the specified length, scalar value, and dtype. The function also handles special cases such as filling an array with NaNs or converting a scalar value to a string object.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the code is not equivalent. The two code snippets have different implementations. The key differences are:

1. In the first code snippet, the function uses the `np.full()` function to create an array with a specified `length`, filled with `value` and of `dtype`. The second code snippet first creates an empty array of length `length` using `np.empty()` and then fills it with `value`.

2. The second code snippet has additional logic to handle `NaN` values for integer and string data types. It coerces the data type to `float64` if the data type is integer and the value is `NaN`. Similarly, if the data type is a string data type, it coerces the data type to `object` and converts the value to a string using `to_str()`.

3. The second code snippet has a check for `length` before coercing the data type to `float64` for `NaN` values. This ensures that the data type is not coerced to `float64` for zero-length arrays, which is not necessary.

So, the two code snippets are not equivalent.
