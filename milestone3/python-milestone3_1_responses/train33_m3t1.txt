What does the following code do? 
The code defines a function `scatter_plot` that generates a scatter plot of two columns of a Pandas DataFrame. The function takes the following arguments:

- `data`: the DataFrame containing the data to be plotted
- `x`: the column name for the x-axis values
- `y`: the column name for the y-axis values
- `by` (optional): a column to group the data by, resulting in a separate scatter plot for each group
- `ax` (optional): a Matplotlib axis object to use for the plot
- `figsize` (optional): a tuple specifying the width and height of the plot in inches
- `grid` (optional): a boolean indicating whether or not to show the grid on the plot
- `kwargs` (optional): other keyword arguments to be passed to the `scatter` function in Matplotlib

The function first imports Matplotlib, sets default values for some plotting keyword arguments, and defines a nested function `plot_group` that actually generates the scatter plot for a single group of data. If the `by` argument is provided, the data is grouped by the specified column and a separate scatter plot is generated for each group. If `by` is not provided, a single scatter plot is generated for the entire DataFrame.

The function returns a Matplotlib figure object.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. The second code has some missing functionality that the first code has. Specifically, the first code creates multiple subplots when the `by` parameter is passed, with each subplot showing the scatter plot for a different group of the data grouped by the `by` parameter. The second code does not have this functionality, and instead calls a `_grouped_plot` function, which is not defined in the code snippet and may be defined elsewhere in the program.
