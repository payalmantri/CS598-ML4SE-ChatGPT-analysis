What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a function `is_sequence` that checks if an object is a sequence of objects. It first checks if the object is an instance of `str` or `bytes`, since they are not considered as sequences here. Then, it tries to obtain the length of the object using the `len` function. If the object does not support the `len` function or it is empty, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it iterates over the object and breaks out of the loop immediately, returning `True` if the loop is executed at least once. If the loop is not executed, it means that the object is empty, so the function returns `False`. In summary, the function returns `True` if the object is not a string or bytes, has a length greater than 0, and is iterable.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code is equivalent to the original code. Both versions check whether the object is iterable and has a length associated with it. They also exclude strings from being sequences.
