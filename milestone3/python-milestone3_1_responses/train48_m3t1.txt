What does the following code do? 
The `lr_find2` method is a variant of the `lr_find` method that helps find the best learning rate. However, instead of doing an epoch, it only runs a fixed number of iterations specified by the `num_it` argument. At each step, it computes the validation loss and the metrics on the next batch of the validation data, making it slower than the `lr_find` method. It uses the `LR_Finder2` class to schedule the learning rates and update them at each iteration based on the validation loss. The `stop_dv` parameter determines whether to stop or not when the loss starts to explode. The method saves the current model weights in a temporary file before running and reloads them after completion.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code is equivalent to the following code. There are no differences in the code logic or functionality between the two.
