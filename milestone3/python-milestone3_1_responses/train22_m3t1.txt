What does the following code do? 
The function `maybe_convert_platform_interval` is a wrapper function that takes an array-like object `values` as input, and attempts to convert it to the appropriate platform-specific data type using the `maybe_convert_platform` function. The wrapper function has special casing for `IntervalArray`, which is a type of array used to represent intervals of numbers. 

If `values` is a list or tuple, the wrapper function first checks if it is empty. If it is empty, it returns an empty numpy array with dtype `np.int64`, instead of the default `object` dtype. This is because the `IntervalArray` cannot have an object dtype. If `values` is not empty, the function converts it to a numpy array using `np.asarray`.

If `values` is a categorical dtype, it is also converted to a numpy array using `np.asarray`. Finally, the function calls `maybe_convert_platform` on the converted `values` array and returns the result.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the above two codes are not equivalent. The first code checks whether the input `values` is a list or tuple and whether it is empty, and returns an empty NumPy array with a `dtype` of `np.int64` in that case. It then converts the input `values` to a NumPy array using `np.asarray` if it is not already a NumPy array or a pandas `Categorical` dtype. Finally, it returns the result of calling the `maybe_convert_platform` function on the input `values`.

The second code only checks whether the input `values` is a list or tuple and whether it is empty. If it is empty, it returns an empty NumPy array with a `dtype` of `np.int64`. Otherwise, it checks whether the input `values` is a pandas `Categorical` dtype, and converts it to a NumPy array using `np.asarray` if it is. Finally, it returns the result of calling the `maybe_convert_platform` function on the input `values`. 

Thus, the first code has an additional check to handle empty lists/tuples that are not handled in the second code.

would the output between the two codes be the same

Yes, the output of the two codes would be the same in most cases.

The only difference in output would be for the case where the input to the function maybe_convert_platform_interval() is an empty list or tuple. In the original code, if the input is an empty list or tuple, the function returns a NumPy array with dtype np.int64. In the modified code, if the input is an empty list or tuple, the function returns a NumPy array with dtype np.float64. This is because in the modified code, the condition isinstance(values, (list, tuple)) and len(values) == 0 is evaluated first, and the dtype is explicitly set to np.int64. If this condition is not satisfied, the second condition is checked, and if is_categorical_dtype(values) returns True, the dtype of the array is set to np.asarray(values) which is np.float64. In most cases, the difference in dtype is not significant and the output would be the same.
