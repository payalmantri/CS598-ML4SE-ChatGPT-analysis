What does the following code do? 
The `batch_face_locations` function takes a list of images as input and returns a list of tuples of found face locations in CSS (top, right, bottom, left) order using the CNN face detector. It is optimized for GPU processing by processing images in batches of size `batch_size`. 

The function first splits the input images into batches using list comprehension. Then, for each batch of images, it calls `_raw_face_locations_batched` function to get the raw face detections in batched form. After that, it uses `_trim_css_to_bounds` and `_rect_to_css` functions to convert the raw face detection coordinates to CSS coordinates. Finally, it extends the CSS faces list with the batch's CSS faces and returns the complete list of CSS faces.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. 

The original code uses a for loop to iterate through each batch of images and process them one at a time, while the second code uses the `map` function to apply the `convert_cnn_detections_to_css` function to each batch of raw detections.

In addition, the original code uses a helper function called `get_css_faces_batch` to process each batch of images, while the second code includes the processing logic directly in the main function.

Finally, the second code returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the face locations for a single batch, while the original code returns a single list containing all the face locations for all batches.

what is the difference in the outputs of the given codes

The outputs of the two code snippets will be different.

The first code snippet returns a flat list of bounding box tuples for all detected faces across all input images. Each bounding box tuple contains the top, right, bottom, and left coordinates of a detected face in CSS order.

The second code snippet returns a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to the detected faces in a single input image. Each inner list contains the bounding box tuples for the detected faces in that image. 

Therefore, the first code snippet provides a flattened list of all detected faces, regardless of which input image they belong to. The second code snippet returns a nested list, where each element of the outer list corresponds to one of the input images, and contains the bounding boxes of the faces detected in that image.

The choice of which code to use would depend on the specific use case and the desired format of the output.

the first snippet also returns a list of lists

I apologize for my mistake in my previous response. You are correct that the first code snippet returns a list of bounding box tuples for each input image, and each list is nested within an outer list. Therefore, the outputs of the two code snippets are more similar than I originally stated.

However, there is still a difference in the structure of the outputs. The first code snippet returns a flat list of bounding box tuples for all detected faces across all input images, where the order of the tuples in the list corresponds to the order of the input images. In contrast, the second code snippet returns a nested list of bounding box tuples, where each inner list corresponds to the detected faces in a single input image.

So, while both code snippets detect the same number of faces and return the same number of bounding boxes, the order of the boxes in the output list is different, with the first code snippet returning a flattened list of boxes across all images, while the second code snippet returns a nested list of boxes for each image.
