What does the following code do? 
The code defines a function `get_language_model` that creates a language model using the specified architecture, vocabulary size, configuration, and dropout. 

It first retrieves metadata about the model architecture from the dictionary `_model_meta` using the specified architecture. It then creates a copy of the configuration specified in the metadata or the user-provided configuration. The dropout multiplier is applied to the probability values in the configuration that end with "_p". The values for tying weights, output probability, and output bias are then retrieved from the configuration and removed from the dictionary. The initialization function is also retrieved and removed from the dictionary if it exists.

Next, the encoder is created by calling the specified architecture with the vocabulary size and modified configuration as arguments. If `tie_weights` is True in the configuration, the encoder's embedding layer is tied to the decoder's weight matrix. The decoder is then created using the `LinearDecoder` class, which takes the vocabulary size, the hidden size from the architecture's metadata, the output probability, and the tied encoder and bias as arguments. Finally, the encoder and decoder are combined into a `SequentialRNN` model, which is returned as is if no initialization function was specified or with the initialization function applied to its parameters.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the above code and the following code are equivalent.
