What does the following code do? 
The function `construct_1d_ndarray_preserving_na` constructs a new one-dimensional numpy ndarray from a sequence of values. The resulting ndarray will have the same shape as `values` and will have the specified data type `dtype`. If `dtype` is not specified, then the function will attempt to infer the data type from the values in `values`.

The function handles missing values (NaN or None) in the input sequence. If the dtype is a string dtype, then missing values are preserved. Otherwise, missing values are converted to the corresponding NaN representation of the data type.

If the specified dtype is a string dtype, then the function first constructs an ndarray with object dtype, then updates the missing values with the corresponding string values. Finally, it converts the resulting ndarray to the specified dtype.

The function returns the resulting ndarray.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two functions are not equivalent. The difference is in the way they handle the `dtype` argument. In the first function, if `dtype` is not `None` and `dtype.kind` is in `("U", "S")`, it performs an additional pass over the data to update the `NA` values before casting the `subarr` to `dtype`. In the second function, it first casts `values` to `dtype`, and then performs an additional pass over the data to update the `NA` values only if `dtype` is not `None` and `dtype.kind` is in `("U", "S")`.
