What does the following code do? 
The `_int_size_to_type` function returns the corresponding Catalyst data type based on the size of integers. It takes a size parameter, which is an integer representing the size of the integer data type. It returns the corresponding Catalyst data type, which could be `ByteType`, `ShortType`, `IntegerType`, or `LongType`, depending on the size of the integer. 

The function uses a dictionary, `type_size_dict`, to map integer sizes to their corresponding Catalyst data types. It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary in ascending order, and if the given size is less than or equal to the current integer size, it returns the corresponding Catalyst data type. If the size is greater than 64, which is the maximum size for an integer in Spark, the function returns `LongType` as a fallback option.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two code snippets are functionally equivalent. The second code snippet is a simplified version of the first one that directly checks the size of the integer instead of using a dictionary to map the size to the corresponding data type. Both functions return the same output for the same input, and they handle the same edge cases.
