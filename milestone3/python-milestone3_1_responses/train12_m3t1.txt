What does the following code do? 
The above code defines a private function `_parse_datatype_string` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a Spark data type object. The function tries to parse the input string in three different formats and returns the parsed data type object if it succeeds. 

The first format is a DDL (Data Definition Language) format in the form of "fieldname datatype, fieldname datatype". The function tries to parse this format by passing the string to the `org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.fromDDL` method of the active Spark context, converting the resulting `StructType` object to JSON format, and passing the JSON string to `_parse_datatype_json_string`. 

The second format is a backward compatibility format that allows for atomic types such as "integer" or complex types such as "struct<fieldname: datatype>". The function tries to parse this format by passing the string to the `parseDataType` method of `PythonSQLUtils`, which is part of the Java API of Spark. The resulting data type is also converted to JSON format and passed to `_parse_datatype_json_string`.

The third format is another backward compatibility format in the form of "fieldname: datatype, fieldname: datatype". The function tries to parse this format by wrapping the input string with "struct<" and ">" and passing it to the `parseDataType` method of `PythonSQLUtils`. The resulting data type is also converted to JSON format and passed to `_parse_datatype_json_string`.

If all three attempts fail, the function raises an exception.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
Yes, the two code snippets are equivalent. The second code snippet provides an implementation of the `_parse_datatype_string` function with a more detailed description and additional doctests.
