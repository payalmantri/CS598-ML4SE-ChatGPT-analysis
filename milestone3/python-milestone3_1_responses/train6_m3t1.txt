What does the following code do? 
The given code defines a function `load_image_file` that loads an image file in either 'RGB' (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) or 'L' (black and white) format into a NumPy array. 

The function takes two arguments: `file` and `mode`. The `file` argument can be either an image file name or a file object to load. The `mode` argument specifies the format to convert the image to. 

The function first opens the image file in binary mode and reads its contents using `with open(file, 'rb') as f:`. It then uses the `BytesIO` class from the `io` module to create an in-memory binary stream from the image data read from the file. The `Image` class from the `Pillow` library is then used to create a PIL (Python Imaging Library) image object from the binary stream. The `convert()` method of the image object is called to convert the image to the specified format (`'RGB'` or `'L'`). The resulting PIL image is then converted to a NumPy array using the `np.array()` function and returned.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
The functionality of the two codes is essentially the same, as both take an image file, open it as a PIL Image object, convert it to the specified mode (if specified), and return a numpy array. However, there are some differences in implementation:

- The first code uses `BytesIO` to read the image file contents and then opens it with `Image.open()`, whereas the second code directly opens the file with `PIL.Image.open()`.
- The first code raises a `ValueError` with a specific message if the file cannot be opened or the image cannot be loaded, whereas the second code does not specify the reason for any exception that is raised.
- The first code does not check if the `mode` parameter is valid, whereas the second code raises a `ValueError` if the mode is not 'RGB' or 'L'.
