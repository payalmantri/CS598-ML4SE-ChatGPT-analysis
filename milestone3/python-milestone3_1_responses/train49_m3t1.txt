What does the following code do? 
The `predict_array` method takes a numpy array `arr` as input, sets the model to evaluation mode (`self.model.eval()`), passes the input through the model (`self.model(to_gpu(V(T(arr)))`) to obtain the predictions, and then returns the predictions as a numpy array (`to_np()`).

The input is first converted to a PyTorch Variable (`T(arr)`) and then wrapped in a `torch.autograd.Variable` and transferred to the GPU (`V()` and `to_gpu()`). The `to_np()` function converts the output to a numpy array.
Is the above code equivalent to the following code? 
No, the two codes are not equivalent. The second code assumes that the model is already loaded onto the GPU, whereas the first code loads the model onto the GPU using the `to_gpu` function. Additionally, the `T` function is not defined in the second code, so it would raise an error.
