 What do you know abou the following code? 
  @CommandArgument
  public void addroles(
      @OptionArgument("username") String username,
      @OptionArgument("roles") String roles) {

    User user = users.get(username);

    if (user != null) {
      user.roles.addAll(Arrays.asList(roles.split(",")));
    } else {
      System.err.println(String.format("User '%s' does not exist", username));
    }

  }
Response:
This is a method annotated with `@CommandArgument`, which suggests that it's part of a command-line application. This particular method named `addroles` takes in two parameters: `username` and `roles`.  

The `@OptionArgument` annotation suggests that both parameters are optional, and can be passed in as options on the command line like `--username=johndoe --roles=admin,manager`. The `String username` parameter represents the username for which we want to add roles. The user object corresponding to this username is retrieved from a `users` map. If the user exists, their role list is updated with a comma-separated string of roles passed via the `roles` parameter. If the user doesn't exist, an error message is printed to standard error.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
@CommandArgument
public void addroles(
    @OptionArgument(""username"") String username,
    @OptionArgument(""roles"") String roles) {

  if (!users.containsKey(username)) {
    System.err.println(String.format(""User '%s' does not exist"", username));
    return;
  }

  User user = users.get(username);
  user.roles.addAll(Arrays.asList(roles.split("","")));
}

Response:
This code defines a method with the name "addroles" that takes two arguments: a string called "username" and another string called "roles". The method checks if the "users" collection contains the given "username", and if it does not, then it prints an error message and returns. If the given "username" exists, then it retrieves the corresponding "User" object from the "users" collection and adds the list of roles represented by the "roles" argument to the user's "roles" field. The "@CommandArgument" annotation is used to mark the method as a command, and the "@OptionArgument" annotation is used to mark the method's arguments as options that can be passed in through the command line.

  users.put(username, user);
}
Response:
This code is defining a method called "addroles" which takes two arguments "username" and "roles". The "@CommandArgument" annotation on top of the method indicates that it is a command argument. The "@OptionArgument" annotations indicate that the respective arguments are options to the command.

The code retrieves a user object from a "users" map using the provided "username". It then checks if the user exists, and if not, prints an error message and returns. 

If the user exists, it splits the "roles" string by comma-separated values into a list of newRoles. It then retrieves the user's current roles from the "user" object and combines them with the new roles. Finally, the updated user object is put back into the users map with the updated roles.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above semantically equivalent? 

Response:
No, the 3 code snippets discussed above are not semantically equivalent. 

The first code snippet defines a function called "sum" which takes in two parameters and returns their sum. 

The second code snippet defines an arrow function with the same functionality as the "sum" function in the first snippet. 

The third code snippet uses the built-in "reduce" method to sum all the elements in an array. It is different from the first two snippets because it doesn't take in two parameters, but rather operates on an array.
