 What do you know abou the following code? 
    public static void copyFile(File from, File to) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(from));
        try {
            OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(to));
            try {
                IoUtils.copyAllBytes(in, out);
            } finally {
                IoUtils.safeClose(out);
            }
        } finally {
            IoUtils.safeClose(in);
        }
    }
Response:
This code defines a static method named `copyFile` that takes two `File` parameters - `from` and `to` - and copies the contents of the first file to the second one. It throws an `IOException` if there's an error during the copy operation.

The code uses Java's IO classes - `InputStream`, `BufferedInputStream`, `FileInputStream`, `OutputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`, and `FileOutputStream` - to read from the source file and write to the destination file. It also calls a custom `IoUtils` class's methods `copyAllBytes` and `safeClose` to handle the copying and closing of the input and output streams respectively, with the help of try-with-resources block.

Overall, the code is a standard way of copying files in Java, covering different types of I/O related exceptions.

Response:
This code defines a method `copyFile` that copies the contents of one file to another. It takes two arguments - a `File` object representing the source file and a `File` object representing the destination file. It throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs during the copy.

The method initializes `InputStream` and `OutputStream` variables to null, then creates a `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream` using the provided `File` objects as input and output streams, respectively. Finally, it calls the `copyAllBytes` method from the `IoUtils` class to copy every byte from the input stream to the output stream.

The `finally` block ensures that both the input and output streams are safely closed after the copying is complete, using the `safeClose` method also from the `IoUtils` class.

}
Response:
This code defines a static method `copyFile` that takes two parameters of type `File`. The method copies the contents of the `from` file to the `to` file. 

To achieve this, the method creates an input stream from the `from` file and an output stream to the `to` file. It reads data from the input stream in chunks of 1024 bytes using a buffer, and writes those chunks to the output stream. 

The `try` block includes the main logic for reading and writing data. The `finally` block ensures that both streams are closed even if an exception is thrown during the copy process. The `IoUtils.safeClose` method is used to close the streams safely. 

This code can throw an `IOException` if there is a problem reading from or writing to the files.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above semantically equivalent? 

Response:
Based on the code snippets discussed, it is difficult to say whether they are semantically equivalent or not. This would depend on the specific context and purpose of each snippet. However, if they perform similar operations and produce the same output, they can be considered functionally equivalent.
