                                }
                                
                                ySortedEdges_[i] = null;
                        }

                        activeEdgesTable_ = null;
                }
                
                minY_ = height_;

Response:
The given code snippet appears to be a method called `startAddingEdges()`. Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It checks if `numEdges_` (presumably a variable representing the number of edges) is greater than 0.
2. If `numEdges_` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the following steps:
   - It iterates over the `height_` variable (assuming it represents the height of some data structure) using a `for` loop.
   - Within the loop, it iterates over a linked list of edges stored in the `ySortedEdges_` array at index `i`.
   - For each edge (`e`), it sets `p` as a reference to `e`, moves `e` to the next edge in the list, and sets `p.next` to `null`. This effectively disconnects the edges from the linked list.
   - After traversing the linked list, it sets the `ySortedEdges_[i]` to `null`, indicating that the list is now empty.
3. It sets `activeEdgesTable_` to `null`, presumably clearing any associated data structure.
4. It updates `minY_` to the value of `height_` (assuming it represents the lowest Y-coordinate) and `maxY_` to -1, effectively resetting the minimum and maximum Y-coordinates.
5. It sets `numEdges_` to 0, indicating that there are no edges present.

In summary, this code prepares the data structure for adding new edges by clearing existing edges and resetting relevant variables to their initial states.

Response:
The given code snippet appears to be a method called `startAddingEdges()`. Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It checks if `numEdges_` (presumably a variable representing the number of edges) is equal to 0.
2. If `numEdges_` is equal to 0, it returns immediately without performing any further actions.
3. If `numEdges_` is not equal to 0, it proceeds with the following steps:
   - It iterates over the `height_` variable (assuming it represents the height of some data structure) using a `for` loop.
   - Within the loop, it traverses a linked list of edges stored in the `ySortedEdges_` array at index `i`.
   - Using a `while` loop, it iterates through the linked list and performs the following actions:
     - It sets `p` as a reference to the current edge (`e`).
     - It moves `e` to the next edge in the list.
     - It sets `p.next` to `null`, effectively disconnecting the edge from the linked list.
   - After traversing the linked list, it sets the `ySortedEdges_[i]` to `null`, indicating that the list is now empty.
4. It sets `activeEdgesTable_` to `null`, presumably clearing any associated data structure.
5. It updates `minY_` to the value of `height_` (assuming it represents the lowest Y-coordinate) and `maxY_` to -1, effectively resetting the minimum and maximum Y-coordinates.
6. It sets `numEdges_` to 0, indicating that there are no edges present.

In summary, this code clears existing edges and resets relevant variables to their initial states in preparation for adding new edges.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
public final void startAddingEdges(Edge[][] sortedEdges, int numEdges, int height) {
    if (numEdges <= 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {

    maxY_ = -1;

}
Response:
The given code snippet appears to be a method called `startAddingEdges()`, which takes in three parameters: `sortedEdges`, `numEdges`, and `height`. Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It checks if the value of `numEdges` is less than or equal to 0.
2. If `numEdges` is less than or equal to 0, it returns immediately without performing any further actions.
3. If `numEdges` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the following steps:
   - It iterates over the `height` variable (presumably representing the height of some data structure) using a `for` loop.
   - Within the outer loop, it retrieves the `edges` array from the `sortedEdges` array at index `i`.
   - It checks if the `edges` array is not null.
   - If the `edges` array is not null, it proceeds with an inner loop:
     - It iterates over the elements of the `edges` array using a `for` loop.
     - Within the inner loop, it sets each element of the `edges` array to `null`, effectively clearing the array.
   - After the inner loop, it sets the `sortedEdges[i]` to `null`, indicating that the array is now empty.
4. It sets `activeEdgesTable_` to `null`, presumably clearing any associated data structure.
5. It updates `minY_` to the value of `height` (assuming it represents the lowest Y-coordinate) and `maxY_` to -1, effectively resetting the minimum and maximum Y-coordinates.
6. It sets `numEdges_` to 0, indicating that there are no edges present.

In summary, this code clears existing edges stored in a two-dimensional array (`sortedEdges`) and resets relevant variables to their initial states in preparation for adding new edges.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above equivalent? 

Response:
Yes, the three code snippets discussed above are equivalent. They all serve the same purpose of clearing existing edges and resetting relevant variables. While there are minor differences in the variable names and parameter usage, the overall logic and functionality remain the same. The code ensures that if the number of edges is zero or less, it returns early without performing any further actions. Otherwise, it iterates over the data structure (either `ySortedEdges_` or `sortedEdges`) and clears the edges by setting them to `null`. Finally, it resets the necessary variables to their initial states.
