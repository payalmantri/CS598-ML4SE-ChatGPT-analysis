Response:
This is a method in Java that starts the process of adding edges. Here's an overview of what this code does:

1. The method checks if there are any edges present in the graph by checking the value of "numEdges_". If there are no edges, the method returns without doing anything.

2. If edges are present, the method iterates through all the edges in the "ySortedEdges_" array. This array contains a list of all the edges sorted by their y-coordinates.

3. For each edge in the array, the method removes it from the linked list and sets its "next" reference to null. 

4. After all the edges have been removed, the "ySortedEdges_" array is set to null.

5. Finally, the method resets certain variables such as "minY_", "maxY_", and "numEdges_". These variables keep track of various properties of the graph. 

Overall, this method seems to be used to reset the state of the graph before adding new edges or performing other operations.

Response:
This code appears to be a method called `startAddingEdges()`. 

The first `if` statement checks if the `numEdges_` variable is equal to 0. If it is, the method immediately returns and does not execute the rest of the code. 

If `numEdges_` is not equal to 0, the method proceeds to a `for` loop that iterates through every value from 0 up to the value of `height_`. 

Within each iteration of the loop, the code sets an `Edge` variable `e` to the value of `ySortedEdges_[i]`. It then enters a `while` loop that repeatedly sets a variable `p` to `e`, sets `e` to the next edge in the linked list, and sets `p.next` to null. Essentially, this code appears to be clearing out the linked list of edges for a particular y-coordinate.

After each iteration of the `while` loop, the code sets `ySortedEdges_[i]` to null. 

Finally, the method sets `activeEdgesTable_` to null, sets `minY_` to the value of `height_`, sets `maxY_` to -1, and sets `numEdges_` to 0. These actions appear to be resetting various state variables for this object.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
public final void startAddingEdges(Edge[][] sortedEdges, int numEdges, int height) {
    if (numEdges <= 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        Edge[] edges = sortedEdges[i];
        if (edges != null) {

                edges[j] = null;
            }
            sortedEdges[i] = null;
        }
    }
    
    activeEdgesTable_ = null;
    minY_ = height;
    maxY_ = -1;
    numEdges_ = 0;
}
Response:
This code is defining a method called `startAddingEdges` which takes three parameters - a 2D array of `Edge` objects called `sortedEdges`, an integer called `numEdges`, and an integer called `height`. The method has a return type of `void`, meaning it does not return anything.

The first thing the method does is check if `numEdges` is less than or equal to zero. If that's the case, the method returns immediately without doing anything else.

Otherwise, the method proceeds to loop over each row in the `sortedEdges` array, up to the `height` value given as a parameter. For each row, the method sets all its elements to `null`. Once all the rows have been looped over, the method sets the entire `sortedEdges` array to `null`.

Finally, the method sets a number of instance variables (not shown in the code you provided) to `null` or specific values.
