        }
Response:
The provided code snippet appears to be a method named `_norm` that calculates the norm of a 2-dimensional point (represented by the `x` and `y` variables) based on a given metric. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Method Signature: The method is private (denoted by the underscore prefix), and it returns a `double` value. It takes an integer parameter named `metric`.

2. Input Validation: The code begins with an `if` statement that checks two conditions:

   - `metric < 0`: It checks if the `metric` value is less than zero. If it is, the code returns `NaN` (Not-a-Number), indicating an invalid result.
  
   - `_isNan()`: It calls a method `_isNan()` (not shown in the provided code) to check for any additional conditions that might make the result invalid. If this condition is true, the code also returns `NaN`.

3. Norm Calculation: Following the input validation, the code uses a `switch` statement to calculate the norm based on different metrics. The `metric` value is evaluated against different cases:

   - Case 0: L-infinite Metric: If `metric` is 0, the code calculates the norm using the L-infinite metric. It returns the maximum absolute value between `Math.abs(x)` and `Math.abs(y)`.
  
   - Case 1: L1 or Manhattan Metric: If `metric` is 1, the code calculates the norm using the L1 or Manhattan metric. It returns the sum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` (`Math.abs(x) + Math.abs(y)`).
  
   - Case 2: L2 or Euclidean Metric: If `metric` is 2, the code calculates the norm using the L2 or Euclidean metric. It returns the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y` (`Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)`).
  
   - Default Case: For any other value of `metric`, the code calculates the norm using a more general formula. It raises `x` and `y` to the power of `metric`, sums them, and then raises the result to the power of `1/metric`. The formula used is based on the p-norm concept in mathematics.

4. Returning the Norm: Depending on the `metric` value and the corresponding case, the code returns the calculated norm as a `double` value.

Overall, the `_norm` method calculates the norm of a 2-dimensional point using different metrics, with the choice of metric determined by the `metric` parameter.

Response:
The provided code snippet is a modified version of the previous `_norm` method. It calculates the norm of a 2-dimensional point based on a given metric. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Method Signature: The method is private (denoted by the underscore prefix), and it returns a `double` value. It takes an integer parameter named `metric`.

2. Variable Declaration: The code declares a local variable `result` of type `double`. This variable will hold the calculated norm value.

3. Input Validation and Norm Calculation: The code uses a combination of `if` and `else` statements to perform input validation and calculate the norm.

   - Input Validation: The code checks two conditions:
      - `metric < 0`: It checks if the `metric` value is less than zero.
      - `_isNan()`: It calls a method `_isNan()` (not shown in the provided code) to check for any additional conditions that might make the result invalid.
   
     If either of these conditions is true, the code assigns `NumberUtils.NaN()` (a representation of NaN) to the `result` variable.

   - Norm Calculation: If the input validation conditions are not met, the code proceeds to calculate the norm using the same logic as before:

      - If `metric` is 0, the code calculates the L-infinite norm by comparing the absolute values of `x` and `y` and assigning the maximum to `result`.
      - If `metric` is 1, the code calculates the L1 or Manhattan norm by summing the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
      - If `metric` is 2, the code calculates the L2 or Euclidean norm using the square root of the sum of squares of `x` and `y`.
      - For any other value of `metric`, the code calculates the norm using the generalized formula mentioned before.

     The calculated norm value is assigned to the `result` variable.

4. Returning the Norm: After the calculation is complete, the code returns the `result` variable, which contains the calculated norm as a `double` value.

The overall functionality of the code remains the same as the previous version, with some modifications in terms of variable declaration and the use of `if` and `else` statements for improved code readability.

Response:
The provided code snippet is a modified version of the `_norm` method. It calculates the norm of a 2-dimensional point based on a given metric. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Method Signature: The method is private (denoted by the underscore prefix), and it returns a `double` value. It takes an integer parameter named `metric`.

2. Variable Declaration and Initialization: The code declares and initializes several local variables:
   - `result`: It is initialized to 0 and will hold the calculated norm value.
   - `x_squared` and `y_squared`: They are initialized by squaring the `x` and `y` values, respectively. These variables store the squared values for later calculations.

3. Norm Calculation: The code uses `if` and `else if` statements to calculate the norm based on the given metric:

   - If `metric` is 0, the code calculates the L-infinite norm by comparing the absolute values of `x` and `y` and assigning the maximum to `result`.
   - If `metric` is 1, the code calculates the L1 or Manhattan norm by summing the absolute values of `x` and `y`.
   - If `metric` is 2, the code calculates the L2 or Euclidean norm by taking the square root of the sum of `x_squared` and `y_squared`.
   - If `metric` is greater than or equal to 3, the code calculates the norm using a generalized formula. It raises `x_squared` and `y_squared` to the power of `metric/2`, sums them, and then raises the result to the power of `1/metric`. The formula used is based on the p-norm concept in mathematics.

   The calculated norm value is assigned to the `result` variable.

4. Input Validation: The code performs input validation similar to the previous versions. It checks two conditions:
   - `metric < 0`: It checks if the `metric` value is less than zero.
   - `_isNan()`: It calls a method `_isNan()` (not shown in the provided code) to check for any additional conditions that might make the result invalid.

   If either of these conditions is true, the code assigns `NumberUtils.NaN()` (a representation of NaN) to the `result` variable.

5. Returning the Norm: After the calculation is complete and input validation is performed, the code returns the `result` variable, which contains the calculated norm as a `double` value.

The overall functionality of the code remains the same as the previous versions. However, there are some optimizations in variable initialization and reuse, such as computing the squared values of `x` and `y` upfront and reusing them in subsequent calculations. These optimizations can improve code efficiency and readability.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above semantically equivalent? 

Response:
No, the three code snippets discussed above are not semantically equivalent. While they have similarities in terms of calculating the norm of a 2-dimensional point based on a given metric, there are notable differences:

1. Code Snippet 1:
   - Assigns the norm calculation directly to the `result` variable.
   - Checks for invalid conditions (negative `metric` or NaN) before calculating the norm.

2. Code Snippet 2:
   - Declares and initializes the `result` variable to 0.
   - Computes the squared values of `x` and `y` before calculating the norm.
   - Checks for the L-infinite, L1, L2 metrics, and a generalized case where `metric` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - Performs input validation (negative `metric` or NaN) after calculating the norm.

3. Code Snippet 3:
   - Similar to Code Snippet 2, but with some variable optimizations.
   - Declares and initializes the `result` variable to 0.
   - Computes the squared values of `x` and `y` before calculating the norm.
   - Checks for the L-infinite, L1, L2 metrics, and a generalized case where `metric` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - Performs input validation (negative `metric` or NaN) before calculating the norm.

Although all three code snippets aim to calculate the norm, the differences lie in the way they handle variable initialization, calculation, and input validation. These differences can affect the behavior and correctness of the code, making the snippets not semantically equivalent.
