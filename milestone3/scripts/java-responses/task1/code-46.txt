 What do you know abou the following code? 
  public static String getExtension(String fileName) {
    int pos = fileName.lastIndexOf('.');
    if (pos < 0) {
      return "";
    }
    return fileName.substring(pos + 1);
  }
Response:
The provided code snippet represents a method named `getExtension` that extracts the file extension from a given `fileName` string. It returns the file extension as a `String`.

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1. The method is declared as `public` and `static`, indicating that it can be accessed from outside the class without the need to create an instance of the class.

2. The method takes a `fileName` parameter, which is a `String` representing the name of the file.

3. It returns a `String` representing the file extension.

4. The code begins by initializing an integer variable `pos` with the result of calling the `lastIndexOf()` method on the `fileName` string. This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the dot (`.`) character in the string, indicating the start of the file extension.

5. The code then checks if `pos` is less than 0, which means that no dot character was found in the `fileName`. In such a case, there is no file extension, so an empty string is returned.

6. If `pos` is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that a dot character was found, the code proceeds to extract the file extension. It uses the `substring()` method on the `fileName` string, starting from `pos + 1` to exclude the dot character itself and obtain the portion of the string representing the file extension.

7. The extracted file extension is then returned as the result of the method.

Overall, this code snippet provides a method to extract the file extension from a given file name string. It locates the last dot character in the string and returns the portion of the string after the dot character as the file extension. If no dot character is found, it returns an empty string.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
public static String getExtension(String fileName) {
String extension = "";
int i = fileName.length() - 1;
while (i >= 0 && fileName.charAt(i) != '.') {
extension = fileName.charAt(i) + extension;
i--;
}
return extension;
}
Response:
The provided code snippet represents a method named `getExtension` that extracts the file extension from a given `fileName` string. It returns the file extension as a `String`.

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1. The method is declared as `public` and `static`, indicating that it can be accessed from outside the class without the need to create an instance of the class.

2. The method takes a `fileName` parameter, which is a `String` representing the name of the file.

3. It returns a `String` representing the file extension.

4. The code begins by initializing an empty `String` variable named `extension`.

5. It declares an integer variable `i` and assigns it the value of `fileName.length() - 1`, representing the index of the last character in the `fileName` string.

6. The code enters a `while` loop that iterates as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the character at index `i` in `fileName` is not a dot (`.`) character.

7. Within the loop, the code appends the character at index `i` to the front of the `extension` string by concatenating it with the existing value of `extension`.

8. After appending the character, the index `i` is decremented to move to the previous character in `fileName`.

9. Once the loop ends, the resulting `extension` string contains the file extension in reverse order.

10. The `extension` string is then returned as the result of the method.

Overall, this code snippet provides a method to extract the file extension from a given file name string. It iterates through the characters of the `fileName` string from right to left until it finds a dot (`.`) character or reaches the beginning of the string. It constructs the file extension by concatenating the characters in reverse order. The resulting file extension is returned as a `String`.

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

2. The method takes a `fileName` parameter, which is a `String` representing the name of the file.

3. It returns a `String` representing the file extension.

4. The code initializes an integer variable `pos` with a value of -1. This variable will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of the dot (`.`) character in the `fileName` string.

5. The code enters a `for` loop that iterates over the characters of the `fileName` string. It starts from index 0 and continues until the end of the string.

6. Within the loop, it checks if the character at the current index `i` in `fileName` is equal to the dot (`.`) character. If it is, it updates the value of `pos` to the current index `i`.

7. After the loop ends, the code checks if `pos` is still -1, indicating that no dot character was found in the `fileName` string. In such a case, there is no file extension, so an empty string is returned.

8. If `pos` is not -1, it means that a dot character was found in the `fileName` string. The code uses the `substring()` method on the `fileName` string, starting from `pos + 1` to exclude the dot character itself, and obtains the portion of the string representing the file extension.

9. The extracted file extension is then returned as the result of the method.

Overall, this code snippet provides a method to extract the file extension from a given file name string. It iterates through the characters of the `fileName` string and finds the index of the last dot character. If a dot character is found, it extracts the portion of the string after the dot as the file extension. If no dot character is found, it returns an empty string.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code snippets discussed above equivalent? 

Response:
No, the three code snippets discussed above are not equivalent. While they all aim to extract the file extension from a given file name string, they differ in terms of implementation and logic.

The first code snippet uses the `lastIndexOf()` method to find the index of the last dot character in the `fileName` string and then extracts the file extension using `substring()`. 

The second code snippet uses a `while` loop and character comparisons to extract the file extension by iterating from the end of the `fileName` string.

The third code snippet uses a `for` loop and character comparisons to find the index of the last dot character in the `fileName` string and then extracts the file extension using `substring()`.

Although the desired outcome is the same, the specific implementations of the code snippets differ. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
