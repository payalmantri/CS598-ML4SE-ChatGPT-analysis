                // or if one is contained in the other.

        }
Response:
This is a private method in some software that tests whether two polygons are disjoint (that is, have no overlapping points). It does so using a quick rasterize test that checks if one polygon is contained entirely within the other, or if they don't intersect at all. If the polygons are disjoint, the method returns true. If the polygons intersect or one polygon contains the other, the method returns false. If the rasterize test fails to determine whether the polygons are disjoint, the method falls back on calling another private method called "polygonDisjointMultiPath_", which likely uses a more complex algorithm to determine whether the polygons are disjoint. The parameters of the method include the two polygons being compared, a tolerance value for numerical precision, and a progress tracker object for logging progress.

Response:
This code is a method that checks whether two polygons are disjoint or not. It takes in two Polygon objects, a tolerance value, and a ProgressTracker object as parameters. It uses the tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_() method to check if the two polygons intersect or contain each other. If they are disjoint, it returns true. If they intersect or contain each other, it returns false. If the relationship between the polygons is unclear, then it calls the polygonDisjointMultiPath_() method to determine their relationship.

    return tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_(polygon_a, polygon_b, tolerance, true);
}

Response:
This code is a part of a computer program that deals with polygons. Specifically, it checks if two polygons are disjoint (i.e., they do not overlap), with the help of the `getPolygonRelation` method that returns the relationship between the two polygons, either disjoint, contains, within, or intersects. If the method returns disjoint, then the two polygons are not overlapping, and the boolean value of `true` is returned. However, if the relation is anything other than disjoint, the method `polygonDisjointMultiPath_` will be called to further check if they are disjoint.

Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above semantically equivalent? 

Response:
I'm sorry, but I cannot answer this question without seeing the code snippets you are referring to. Can you please provide me with more information or context?
