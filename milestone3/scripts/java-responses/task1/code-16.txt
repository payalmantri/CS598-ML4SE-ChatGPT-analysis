 What do you know abou the following code? 
/ /Returns true if polygon_a crosses polyline_b.
        private static boolean polygonCrossesPolyline_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Polyline polyline_b, double tolerance,

                // or if one is contained in the other.
                int relation = tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_(polygon_a, polyline_b,

                        return false;

                return polygonCrossesPolylineImpl_(polygon_a, polyline_b, tolerance,
                                null);
        }
Response:
This code is a method that checks if a polygon and a polyline intersect or cross each other. It starts by performing a quick rasterize test to determine if the geometries are disjoint or contained within each other. If that test fails, it proceeds to call the implementation of `polygonCrossesPolylineImpl_()` to perform a more detailed check for crossings. The code takes in parameters such as the polygon, polyline, tolerance, and a progress tracker.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
private static boolean polygonCrossesPolyline_(Polygon polygon_a,
                        Polyline polyline_b, double tolerance,
                        ProgressTracker progress_tracker) {
                boolean result = false;

                int relation = tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_(polygon_a, polyline_b,
                                tolerance, false);

                if (relation != Relation.disjoint && relation != Relation.contains) {
                        result = polygonCrossesPolylineImpl_(polygon_a, polyline_b, tolerance,
                                        null);
                }

                return result;
        }
Response:
This is a private static method called polygonCrossesPolyline_. It takes in four arguments: a Polygon object, a Polyline object, a double value for tolerance, and a ProgressTracker object. The method returns a boolean value.

In this code block, the method first initializes the result variable to false. Then, it calls the tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_ method with the given Polygon and Polyline objects, along with the tolerance value and a boolean indicating whether to use a rasterization algorithm. 

The result of this method call is stored in the relation variable. If the relation is not disjoint or contains, then the polygonCrossesPolylineImpl_ method is called with the same arguments as before except for a null value for an additional argument.

Finally, the method returns the result variable, which will be true if the polygon and polyline intersect within the given tolerance value.

 What do you know abou the following code? 
import java.util.stream.Stream;

// Returns true if polygon_a crosses polyline_b.
private static boolean polygonCrossesPolyline_(Polygon polygon_a,
                            Polyline polyline_b, double tolerance,
                            ProgressTracker progress_tracker) {
    // Quick rasterize test to see whether the the geometries are disjoint,
    // or if one is contained in the other.
    int relation = tryRasterizedContainsOrDisjoint_(polygon_a, polyline_b,
                            tolerance, false);

    if (relation == Relation.disjoint || relation == Relation.contains)
        return false;

    // Stream the line segments of polyline_b
    Stream<LineSegment> lineSegmentsStream = polyline_b.getLineSegmentsStream();

    // Check if any of the line segments intersect with the polygon
    boolean intersects = lineSegmentsStream.anyMatch(lineSegment -> polygon_a.intersects(lineSegment, tolerance));

    return intersects;
}
Response:
This code is a Java method that determines whether a Polygon intersects with a Polyline. The method takes four parameters: `polygon_a` and `polyline_b` are instances of the `Polygon` and `Polyline` classes respectively, `tolerance` is a double value used for precision in the intersection calculation, and `progress_tracker` is an optional parameter to track the progress of the computation.

The first part of the method uses a quick rasterization test to determine whether the two geometries are disjoint or if one is contained in the other. If they are disjoint or one is contained in the other, the method returns false.

The second part of the method uses the Java 8 `Stream` API to stream the line segments of `polyline_b`. It checks if any of these line segments intersect with the `polygon_a` using the `intersects` method of the `Polygon` class. If any intersection is found, the method returns true.

Prompt:
Are the 3 code sninnepts discussed above semantically equivalent? 

Response:
I'm sorry, but I'll need more context to answer this question. Could you please specify which 3 code snippets you're referring to?
