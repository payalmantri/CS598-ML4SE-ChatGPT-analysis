 Mutant 1
Prompt:
Is the following code buggy or correct? 
// Mutant 1 : Replace Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()) with !Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())

int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
        Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
        if (!Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
                return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
        if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
                return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

        throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
The addGeometry method in the EditShape class of the geometri-api-java repository is used to add a Geometry object to an existing EditShape instance. The Geometry object can be of any type, such as Point, Line, Polygon, or MultiPoint.

The method first gets the type of the Geometry object using the getType method. If the type is a MultiPath, the addMultiPath_ method is called with the MultiPath object as a parameter. Similarly, if the type is MultiPoint, the addMultiPoint_ method is called with the MultiPoint object as a parameter.

If the type is not a MultiPath or a MultiPoint, the method throws a GeometryException.GeometryInternalError exception, indicating that the Geometry object is not supported by the EditShape instance.

The addMultiPath_ and addMultiPoint_ methods are private methods in the EditShape class that are used to add MultiPath and MultiPoint objects, respectively, to the EditShape instance. These methods implement the specific logic for adding these types of objects to the shape.
Response:
The provided code contains a bug in the line that checks the type of the `Geometry` object. The bug is introduced by the mutation `!Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())`, which negates the condition `Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())`. 

The correct condition should be `Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())` without the negation. The original code checks if the type of the `Geometry` object is a MultiPath using the `isMultiPath` method of the `Geometry` class. Mutating it to `!Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())` reverses the logic and would produce incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated as follows:

```java
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
    Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
    if (Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
        return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
    if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
        return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

    throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
```

This corrected code ensures that the appropriate method is called based on the type of the `Geometry` object, allowing the object to be added to the `EditShape` instance correctly.

Prompt:
The following code is buggy. Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?
// Mutant 1 : Replace Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()) with !Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())

int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
        Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
        if (!Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
                return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
        if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
                return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

        throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
Response:
The bug in the provided code lies in the mutation `!Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())`, which negates the condition `Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())`. 

The correct condition should be `Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value())` without the negation. By negating the condition, the code is essentially checking if the type of the `Geometry` object is not a MultiPath. However, the original code intends to check if the type is a MultiPath.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated as follows:

```java
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
    Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
    if (Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
        return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
    if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
        return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

    throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
```

With this correction, the code will correctly determine the type of the `Geometry` object and execute the corresponding logic accordingly.

 Mutant 2
Prompt:
Is the following code buggy or correct? 
// Mutant 2 : Replace addMultiPath_ with removeMultiPath_

The addMultiPath_ and addMultiPoint_ methods are private methods in the EditShape class that are used to add MultiPath and MultiPoint objects, respectively, to the EditShape instance. These methods implement the specific logic for adding these types of objects to the shape.
Response:
The provided code with the mutation `replace addMultiPath_ with removeMultiPath_` is buggy. 

In the original code, when the type of the Geometry object is MultiPath, the method correctly calls the `addMultiPath_` method to add the MultiPath object to the EditShape instance. However, in the mutant code, it replaces `addMultiPath_` with `removeMultiPath_`. This means that instead of adding the MultiPath object, it will attempt to remove it from the EditShape instance.

This mutation introduces a logic error and deviates from the intended behavior of the code. The corrected code should remain unchanged from the original implementation:

```java
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
    Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
    if (Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
        return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
    if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
        return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

    throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
```

This code correctly adds the MultiPath or MultiPoint object to the EditShape instance based on its type, ensuring the desired behavior is maintained.

 Mutant 4
Prompt:
Is the following code buggy or correct?

Response:
The provided code with the mutation `remove throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError()` is buggy.

In the original code, if the Geometry object's type is not a MultiPath or MultiPoint, the method throws a `GeometryException.GeometryInternalError` exception. This exception indicates that the Geometry object is not supported by the EditShape instance, providing an appropriate error indication.

By removing the `throw` statement, the mutant code eliminates the exception throwing behavior. As a result, when the Geometry object's type is not a MultiPath or MultiPoint, the method will simply return without providing any indication or handling of the unsupported Geometry type. This behavior deviates from the original intention and may lead to incorrect results or undesired program behavior.

Therefore, the mutant code is buggy, and the original code with the exception throwing statement should be preferred to handle unsupported Geometry types appropriately:

```java
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
    Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
    if (Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
        return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
    if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
        return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

    throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
```

By throwing the exception, the code ensures that unsupported Geometry types are properly handled and that the EditShape instance remains in a valid state.

Prompt:
The following code is buggy. Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?
// Mutant 4 : Remove throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {

}
      
Response:
The provided mutant code, which removes the statement `throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();`, is indeed buggy.

In the original code, if the Geometry object's type is neither MultiPath nor MultiPoint, the `throw` statement is executed. This throws a `GeometryException.GeometryInternalError` exception, indicating that the provided Geometry object is not supported by the EditShape instance. This behavior helps identify and handle unsupported Geometry types correctly.

However, in the mutant code, the `throw` statement is removed. As a result, when the Geometry object's type is not MultiPath or MultiPoint, the code simply continues execution without providing any indication of the unsupported Geometry type. This can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results, as the unsupported Geometry object is not properly handled or rejected.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to retain the original code's exception throwing statement:

```java
int addGeometry(Geometry geometry) {
    Geometry.Type gt = geometry.getType();
    if (Geometry.isMultiPath(gt.value()))
        return addMultiPath_((MultiPath) geometry);
    if (gt == Geometry.Type.MultiPoint)
        return addMultiPoint_((MultiPoint) geometry);

    throw GeometryException.GeometryInternalError();
}
```

This ensures that unsupported Geometry types are appropriately handled and notifies the caller about the invalid input.
