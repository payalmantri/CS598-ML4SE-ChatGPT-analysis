Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The function is_dict_like() takes an object as input and checks whether the object has properties of a dictionary or not.

It does so by checking if the object has the following dictionary-like attributes:

__getitem__: method used for getting an item with a specific key.
keys: method used for returning a list of keys in the dictionary.
__contains__: method used for checking if a key exists in the dictionary.
If the object has all these attributes, the function returns True, indicating that the object is dictionary-like. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function also excludes classes from being considered as dictionary-like by checking if the object is an instance of type.

The function includes examples of how to use it and test cases for some common objects.
Code:
def is_dict_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is dict-like.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_dict_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has dict-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_dict_like({1: 2})
    True
    >>> is_dict_like([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> is_dict_like(dict)
    False
    >>> is_dict_like(dict())
    True
    """
    dict_like_attrs = ("__getitem__", "keys", "__contains__")
    return (all(hasattr(obj, attr) for attr in dict_like_attrs)
            # [GH 25196] exclude classes
            or not isinstance(obj, type))
The code provided appears to be buggy. The logic inside the `return` statement is incorrect. 

The function is intended to return `True` if the object has all the dictionary-like attributes and is not a class, and `False` otherwise. However, the current implementation returns `True` if the object has all the attributes OR is not a class. This means that the function would return `True` for objects that are not dictionary-like, but are not classes either. 

To fix the bug, the logical operator inside the `return` statement should be changed from `or` to `and`.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is the use of the `not` operator in the return statement. The original code uses `not all(...)` to exclude objects that have all of the dictionary-like attributes and are not instances of `type`. This means that objects with all dictionary-like attributes would be classified as not dict-like, which is incorrect. 

The corrected code uses `all(...)` instead of `not all(...)` to properly check if the object has all the dictionary-like attributes, and returns `True` if it does and is not an instance of `type`.
