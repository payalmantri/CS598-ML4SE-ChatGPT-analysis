Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code is a Python function face_encodings() that takes an input image containing one or more human faces and returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each face in the image.

The function first calls another internal function _raw_face_landmarks() that detects and returns the facial landmarks (i.e., the location of important facial features like eyes, nose, etc.) in the input image. The landmarks can be either detected automatically if the optional argument known_face_locations is not provided or can be passed explicitly if known in advance.

Then, for each set of raw facial landmarks, the function computes the face encodings using another internal function face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(). The num_jitters parameter specifies the number of times to re-sample the face when calculating the encoding to improve accuracy (higher num_jitters means more accurate but slower encoding).

Finally, the function returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each detected face in the input image.
Code:
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations=None, num_jitters=1):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
    raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="sssss")
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
The code is buggy because the model parameter in the _raw_face_landmarks() function call is set to an invalid value "sssss". The model parameter should be set to a valid value that specifies the type of face detection model to use, such as "large" or "small".
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the argument 'model="sssss"' passed to the function '_raw_face_landmarks()'. The parameter 'model' only accepts specific values like "large" or "small", and "sssss" is not a valid value. This will raise a ValueError exception, causing the program to terminate.
