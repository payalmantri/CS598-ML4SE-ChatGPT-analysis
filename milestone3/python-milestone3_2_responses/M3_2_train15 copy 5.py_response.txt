Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function that infers the schema of a data row. The function takes in two arguments: row and names.

The row argument can be a dictionary, tuple, list, named tuple, or an object. If it is a dictionary, the function sorts the items in the dictionary by key and value. If it is a tuple, list, or named tuple, the function checks if the row has fields. If it does, the function zips the fields with their respective values. If not, the function creates a default list of field names or adds additional field names to the provided list of field names. Finally, if the row is an object, the function sorts the items in the object's dictionary.

After inferring the fields and their respective data types, the function creates a StructType object, which is a data type in the Apache Spark framework that represents the schema of a DataFrame. The schema is represented by a list of StructField objects, where each StructField object represents a field in the schema. The StructField constructor takes in three arguments: the name of the field, the data type of the field, and a boolean value that indicates whether the field can be null.

Overall, this function infers the schema of a data row and returns a StructType object that can be used to create a DataFrame in Apache Spark.
Code:
def _infer_schema(row, names=None):
    """Infer the schema from dict/namedtuple/object"""
    if isinstance(row, dict):
        items = sorted(row.items())

    elif isinstance(row, (tuple, list)):
        if hasattr(row, "__fields__"):  # Row
            items = zip(row.__fields__, tuple(row))
        elif hasattr(row, "_fields"):  # namedtuple
            items = zip(row._fields, tuple(row))
        else:
            if names is None:
                names = ['_%d' % i for i in range(1, len(row) + 1)]
            elif len(names) < len(row):
                names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names) - 1, len(row) + 1))
            items = zip(names, row)

    elif hasattr(row, "__dict__"):  # object
        items = sorted(row.__dict__.items())

    else:
        raise TypeError("Can not infer schema for type: %s" % type(row))

    fields = [StructField(k, _infer_type(v), True) for k, v in items]
    return StructType(fields)
The code seems to have a bug in the `elif` block that handles cases where `row` is a tuple, list, or named tuple. Specifically, in the `else` block, when `names` is not `None`, the code extends `names` with additional field names, but it uses the wrong range for generating the new field names. Instead of using `range(len(names) + 1, len(row) + 1)`, which generates a range starting from `len(names) + 1` up to and including `len(row)`, the code should use `range(len(names), len(row))`, which generates a range starting from `len(names)` up to but not including `len(row)`. This is because the length of the range should be equal to the number of new field names that need to be added, and the starting index should correspond to the index of the first new field name.

Therefore, the corrected code would be:

```
def _infer_schema(row, names=None):
    """Infer the schema from dict/namedtuple/object"""
    if isinstance(row, dict):
        items = sorted(row.items())

    elif isinstance(row, (tuple, list)):
        if hasattr(row, "__fields__"):  # Row
            items = zip(row.__fields__, tuple(row))
        elif hasattr(row, "_fields"):  # namedtuple
            items = zip(row._fields, tuple(row))
        else:
            if names is None:
                names = ['_%d' % i for i in range(1, len(row) + 1)]
            elif len(names) < len(row):
                names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names), len(row)))
            items = zip(names, row)

    elif hasattr(row, "__dict__"):  # object
        items = sorted(row.__dict__.items())

    else:
        raise TypeError("Can not infer schema for type: %s" % type(row))

    fields = [StructField(k, _infer_type(v), True) for k, v in items]
    return StructType(fields)
```
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the `elif isinstance(row, (tuple, list))` block. Specifically, in the line `elif len(names) < len(row):` the comparison should be `elif len(names) > len(row):`. Currently, the code will extend the `names` list to include additional field names if `names` is shorter than the length of the row. However, it should be extending the `names` list if `names` is longer than the row.
