Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
In the show_prediction_labels_on_image function, the line name = name.encode("UTF-8") is used to convert the name of the recognized person to a byte string in UTF-8 format. This is necessary because the draw.text() function of the Pillow module, which is used to display the name of the recognized person, expects a byte string as input.

If the name of the person contains non-ASCII characters or characters outside of the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), converting it to a byte string in UTF-8 format ensures that the name can be properly displayed by the draw.text() function. If the name is not converted to a byte string, Pillow may raise an exception with a message indicating that the text is not encoded in UTF-8 format.
Code:
def show_prediction_labels_on_image(img_path, predictions):
    """
    Shows the face recognition results visually.

    :param img_path: path to image to be recognized
    :param predictions: results of the predict function
    :return:
    """
    pil_image = Image.open(img_path).convert("RGB")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

    for name, (top, right, bottom, left) in predictions:
        # Draw a box around the face using the Pillow module
        draw.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline=(0, 0, 255))

        # There's a bug in Pillow where it blows up with non-UTF-8 text
        # when using the default bitmap font
        name = name.encode("UTF-8")

        # Draw a label with a name below the face
        text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(name)
        draw.rectangle(((left, bottom + text_height - 10), (right, bottom)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))
        draw.text((left + 6, bottom - text_height - 5), name, fill=(255, 255, 255, 255))

    # Remove the drawing library from memory as per the Pillow docs
    del draw

    # Display the resulting image
    pil_image.show()The code has a bug in the draw.rectangle() call inside the for loop. Specifically, the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle is incorrect. 

Currently, the y-coordinate of the top-left corner is given by `bottom + text_height - 10`. However, this will cause the rectangle to be drawn below the face rather than above it, which is the intended behavior. To fix the bug, the y-coordinate should be `bottom - text_height - 10`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```
def show_prediction_labels_on_image(img_path, predictions):
    """
    Shows the face recognition results visually.

    :param img_path: path to image to be recognized
    :param predictions: results of the predict function
    :return:
    """
    pil_image = Image.open(img_path).convert("RGB")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)

    for name, (top, right, bottom, left) in predictions:
        # Draw a box around the face using the Pillow module
        draw.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline=(0, 0, 255))

        # There's a bug in Pillow where it blows up with non-UTF-8 text
        # when using the default bitmap font
        name = name.encode("UTF-8")

        # Draw a label with a name below the face
        text_width, text_height = draw.textsize(name)
        draw.rectangle(((left, bottom - text_height - 10), (right, bottom)), fill=(0, 0, 255), outline=(0, 0, 255))
        draw.text((left + 6, bottom - text_height - 5), name, fill=(255, 255, 255, 255))

    # Remove the drawing library from memory as per the Pillow docs
    del draw

    # Display the resulting image
    pil_image.show()
```
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code above is in the line where the rectangle is drawn for the label with the name below the face. Specifically, the bottom value of the rectangle is set to `bottom` instead of `bottom + text_height - 10`, which causes the label to overlap with the face box.
