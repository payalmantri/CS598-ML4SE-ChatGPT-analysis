Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code is a Python function face_encodings() that takes an input image containing one or more human faces and returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each face in the image.

The function first calls another internal function _raw_face_landmarks() that detects and returns the facial landmarks (i.e., the location of important facial features like eyes, nose, etc.) in the input image. The landmarks can be either detected automatically if the optional argument known_face_locations is not provided or can be passed explicitly if known in advance.

Then, for each set of raw facial landmarks, the function computes the face encodings using another internal function face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(). The num_jitters parameter specifies the number of times to re-sample the face when calculating the encoding to improve accuracy (higher num_jitters means more accurate but slower encoding).

Finally, the function returns a list of 128-dimensional face encodings, with one encoding for each detected face in the input image.
Code:
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations=None, num_jitters=0):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
    raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="small")
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
The code seems to be correct. However, there are a few things to note:

1. The default value for the `num_jitters` parameter is set to 0. This means that if the user does not specify a value for `num_jitters`, the function will not re-sample the face and will return the encoding with no jittering. This may affect the accuracy of the encodings.

2. It is not clear from the code where the `face_encoder` object comes from. It is possible that this object is defined elsewhere in the code or imported from another module.

3. The `known_face_locations` parameter is optional, which means that the function can detect the face locations automatically if this parameter is not provided. However, if the user already knows the face locations, passing them to the function can improve the accuracy of the face encodings.

Overall, the code seems to be functional, but it may require additional information or modifications depending on the specific use case.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that the variable `raw_landmarks` may be `None` if the optional argument `known_face_locations` is provided, but no face is detected in the image. In that case, the list comprehension in the return statement will raise a `TypeError` because it attempts to iterate over `None`. A possible fix for this issue is to add a check to see if `raw_landmarks` is `None`, and if it is, return an empty list. Here is an updated version of the code with this fix:

```
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations=None, num_jitters=0):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
    raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="small")
    if raw_landmarks is None:
        return []
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
```
