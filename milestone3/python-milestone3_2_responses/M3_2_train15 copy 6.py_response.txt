Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function that infers the schema of a data row. The function takes in two arguments: row and names.

The row argument can be a dictionary, tuple, list, named tuple, or an object. If it is a dictionary, the function sorts the items in the dictionary by key and value. If it is a tuple, list, or named tuple, the function checks if the row has fields. If it does, the function zips the fields with their respective values. If not, the function creates a default list of field names or adds additional field names to the provided list of field names. Finally, if the row is an object, the function sorts the items in the object's dictionary.

After inferring the fields and their respective data types, the function creates a StructType object, which is a data type in the Apache Spark framework that represents the schema of a DataFrame. The schema is represented by a list of StructField objects, where each StructField object represents a field in the schema. The StructField constructor takes in three arguments: the name of the field, the data type of the field, and a boolean value that indicates whether the field can be null.

Overall, this function infers the schema of a data row and returns a StructType object that can be used to create a DataFrame in Apache Spark.
Code:
def _infer_schema(row, names=None):
    """Infer the schema from dict/namedtuple/object"""
    if isinstance(row, dict):
        items = sorted(row.items())

    elif isinstance(row, (tuple, list)):
        if hasattr(row, "__fields__"):  # Row
            items = zip(row.__fields__, tuple(row))
        elif hasattr(row, "_fields"):  # namedtuple
            items = zip(row._fields, tuple(row))
        else:
            if names is None:
                names = ['_%d' % i for i in range(1, len(row) + 1)]
            elif len(names) < len(row):
                names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names) + 1, len(row) - 1))
            items = zip(names, row)

    elif hasattr(row, "__dict__"):  # object
        items = sorted(row.__dict__.items())

    else:
        raise TypeError("Can not infer schema for type: %s" % type(row))

    fields = [StructField(k, _infer_type(v), True) for k, v in items]
    return StructType(fields)
There is a bug in the code. In the elif block for tuples, lists, and namedtuples, the range in the second call to `range()` in the `names.extend()` call should be `len(names), len(row))` instead of `len(names) + 1, len(row) - 1))`. This is because we want to add field names to the existing list `names` starting from the index `len(names)` up to the length of the row `len(row)`.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug is in the following line:

```
elif len(names) < len(row):
    names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names) + 1, len(row) - 1))
```

In this line, the `range` function should include `len(names)` instead of `len(names) + 1`, and the `range` should go up to `len(row)` instead of `len(row) - 1`. 

The corrected line should be:

```
elif len(names) < len(row):
    names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names), len(row)))
```

This line of code is supposed to create default field names if no field names are provided, or add additional field names if the number of provided field names is less than the number of fields in the row. However, the original line of code was creating a range that went up to one less than the length of `row`, which resulted in one less field name being created than there were fields in the row. The corrected line fixes this issue by creating the correct number of field names.
