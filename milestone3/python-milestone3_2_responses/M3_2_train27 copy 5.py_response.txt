Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function called is_sequence() that takes an object as input and checks whether it is a sequence of objects. The function first checks whether the input object is iterable (i.e., it can be looped over) and has a length associated with it using the iter() and len() functions respectively. If these conditions are met, the function then checks whether the input object is a string or bytes using the isinstance() function. If the input object satisfies all these conditions, the function returns True, indicating that the object is a sequence of objects. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function also includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, return value, and provides examples of how to use it.
Code:
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        len(obj)   # Has a length associated with it.
        return isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except (TypeError, AttributeError):
        return False
The code is buggy. 

The problem is in the line `len(obj) # Has a length associated with it.` where the length of the object is computed but not used to check if the object is a sequence. Instead, the function returns the result of `isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))`, which checks if the object is a string or bytes, but does not check if it is a sequence.

To fix the code, the function should check if the object is a sequence before checking if it is a string or bytes. One way to do this is to use the `collections.abc.Sequence` abstract base class to check if the object is a sequence, like this:

```
from collections.abc import Sequence

def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        return isinstance(obj, Sequence) and not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except TypeError:
        return False
```

Here, the `isinstance()` function is used to check if the object is an instance of the `Sequence` abstract base class, and the `not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))` is used to exclude strings and bytes from the sequence check. The `try-except` block is still used to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to check the object's sequence properties.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the line `len(obj)` which is called but not used to check if the object is a sequence. The `len(obj)` call doesn't actually do anything in the code because its result is not checked. 

To fix the bug, the code should check if the object is a sequence before checking if it is a string or bytes. One way to do this is to use the `collections.abc.Sequence` abstract base class to check if the object is a sequence, like this:

```
from collections.abc import Sequence

def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        return isinstance(obj, Sequence) and not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except TypeError:
        return False
```

Here, the `isinstance()` function is used to check if the object is an instance of the `Sequence` abstract base class, and the `not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))` is used to exclude strings and bytes from the sequence check. The `try-except` block is still used to catch any exceptions that might occur when trying to check the object's sequence properties.
