Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
The given code snippet is a function named _int_size_to_type that takes an integer argument size and returns a datatype from the Catalyst library based on the size of the integer. The output of the function is not specified as it is just a definition of a function.

To use the function, you can call it with an integer argument like this:

scss
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.types import *
size = 16
data_type = _int_size_to_type(size)
print(data_type)
The output of this code will depend on the value of size passed as an argument to the function. If size is less than or equal to 8, the function will return ByteType, if size is less than or equal to 16, the function will return ShortType, if size is less than or equal to 32, the function will return IntegerType, and if size is less than or equal to 64, the function will return LongType. If size is greater than 64, the function will not return anything as there is no condition for such a case.
Code:
def _int_size_to_type(size):
    """
    Return the Catalyst datatype from the size of integers.
    """
    if size <= 8:
        return ByteType
    if size <= 16:
        return ShortType
    if size < 32:
        return IntegerType
    if size <= 64:
        return LongType
The code is buggy. The condition in the third if statement should be "if size <= 32" instead of "if size < 32". The current condition would cause the function to return IntegerType only for values of size strictly less than 32, whereas it should return IntegerType for values less than or equal to 32.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is that the third condition is not correct. It should be "if size <= 32" instead of "if size < 32". The current implementation will return IntegerType only for sizes that are exactly 32 and not for sizes less than or equal to 32.
