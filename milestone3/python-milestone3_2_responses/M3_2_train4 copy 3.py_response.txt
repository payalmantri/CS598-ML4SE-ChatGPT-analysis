Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function named _trim_css_to_bounds that takes two arguments: css and image_shape. The purpose of the function is to trim a rectangle represented by a plain tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order, making sure that the values are within the bounds of the image represented by image_shape.

The function returns a new plain tuple with the trimmed values in the same order (top, right, bottom, left). The first element in the tuple is the maximum of the top value and 0, ensuring that it does not go above the image. The second element is the minimum of the right value and the width of the image, ensuring that it does not go beyond the right edge of the image. The third element is the minimum of the bottom value and the height of the image, ensuring that it does not go below the bottom edge of the image. Finally, the fourth element is the maximum of the left value and 0, ensuring that it does not go beyond the left edge of the image.

Overall, this function is useful for image processing applications that need to ensure that rectangles are within the bounds of an image, to avoid errors or invalid output.
Code:
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    return max(css[0], 0), min(css[2], image_shape[1]), min(css[2], image_shape[0]), max(css[3], 0)The code given above is buggy. There are two bugs in the code.

Firstly, the second element returned in the plain tuple is incorrect. Instead of using `css[2]` for the second element, it should use `css[1]` to get the value of the right edge of the rectangle.

Secondly, the third element returned in the plain tuple is incorrect as well. Instead of using `min(css[2], image_shape[0])` for the third element, it should use `min(css[2], image_shape[1])` to get the value of the bottom edge of the rectangle.

Here's the corrected version of the `_trim_css_to_bounds` function:

```
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    top = max(css[0], 0)
    right = min(css[1], image_shape[1])
    bottom = min(css[2], image_shape[0])
    left = max(css[3], 0)
    
    return top, right, bottom, left
```

With this corrected version of the function, all four values of the rectangle are properly trimmed to fit within the bounds of the image, and the function returns a plain tuple with the trimmed values in the correct order.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The code given above has two bugs:

1. The second element returned in the plain tuple is incorrect. Instead of using `css[2]` for the second element, it should use `css[1]` to get the value of the right edge of the rectangle.

2. The third element returned in the plain tuple is incorrect as well. Instead of using `min(css[2], image_shape[0])` for the third element, it should use `min(css[2], image_shape[1])` to get the value of the bottom edge of the rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_trim_css_to_bounds` function:

```
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    top = max(css[0], 0)
    right = min(css[1], image_shape[1])
    bottom = min(css[2], image_shape[0])
    left = max(css[3], 0)
    
    return top, right, bottom, left
```

With this corrected version of the function, all four values of the rectangle are properly trimmed to fit within the bounds of the image, and the function returns a plain tuple with the trimmed values in the correct order.
