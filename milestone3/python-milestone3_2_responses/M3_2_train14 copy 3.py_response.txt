Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This code defines a function named _infer_type which is used to infer the data type of an object based on its value. Here's how it works:

The function takes an argument named obj, which can be of any type.
If obj is None, the function returns a NullType.
If obj has a custom user-defined type (__UDT__ attribute), the function returns that type.
If the type of obj is one of the types defined in _type_mappings, the function returns the corresponding Spark SQL data type.
If obj is a dictionary, the function recursively calls itself on the keys and values of the dictionary to infer the types of the key-value pairs. If all keys and values are None, the function returns a MapType with a key type of NullType and a value type of NullType.
If obj is a list, the function recursively calls itself on the first non-None element of the list to infer the element type, and returns an ArrayType with that element type.
If obj is an array (presumably from the array module), the function checks if the typecode of the array is in _array_type_mappings, and returns an ArrayType with the corresponding Spark SQL data type. Otherwise, it raises a TypeError.
If the above cases do not apply, the function tries to infer the schema of obj using another internal function _infer_schema, and returns the inferred schema as a Spark SQL data type. If _infer_schema raises a TypeError, the function raises a TypeError indicating that the type of obj is not supported.
Code:
def _infer_type(obj):
    """Infer the DataType from obj
    """
    if obj is None:
        return NullType()

    if hasattr(obj, '__UDT__'):
        return obj.__UDT__

    dataType = _type_mappings.get(type(obj))
    if dataType is DecimalType:
        # the precision and scale of `obj` may be different from row to row.
        return DecimalType(38, 18)
    elif dataType is not None:
        return dataType()

    if isinstance(obj, dict):
        for key, value in obj.items():
            if key is None and value is not None:
                return MapType(_infer_type(key), _infer_type(value), True)
        return MapType(NullType(), NullType(), True)
    elif isinstance(obj, list):
        for v in obj:
            if v is not None:
                return ArrayType(_infer_type(obj[0]), True)
        return ArrayType(NullType(), True)
    elif isinstance(obj, array):
        if obj.typecode in _array_type_mappings:
            return ArrayType(_array_type_mappings[obj.typecode](), False)
        else:
            raise TypeError("not supported type: array(%s)" % obj.typecode)
    else:
        try:
            return _infer_schema(obj)
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError("not supported type: %s" % type(obj))
The code appears to be potentially buggy, as there are a few cases where the behavior may not be as intended. 

Firstly, in the case where `obj` is a dictionary and all keys and values are `None`, the function will incorrectly return a `MapType` with a key type and value type of `NullType`, whereas it should be returning `NullType()` instead.

Secondly, in the case where `obj` is a list and all elements are `None`, the function will incorrectly return an `ArrayType` with an element type of `NullType`, whereas it should be returning `ArrayType(NullType(), True)`.

Lastly, in the case where `obj` is an array, the function is assuming that `obj.typecode` is a valid key in `_array_type_mappings`, which may not always be the case. If `obj.typecode` is not a valid key in `_array_type_mappings`, the function will raise a `TypeError`, which may not be the desired behavior.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
Based on the provided code, one possible bug is in the following line:

```
return ArrayType(_infer_type(obj[0]), True)
```

The `obj[0]` parameter should be used instead of `v`, as the latter is the variable used in the for loop to iterate over the list elements. This could cause incorrect type inference for non-homogeneous lists.

Another potential bug is in the following line:

```
dataType = _type_mappings.get(type(obj))
```

If the type of `obj` is not in `_type_mappings`, `dataType` will be set to `None`. The subsequent conditional statements will not handle this case, and will result in a `TypeError` being raised with an unhelpful message. It would be better to handle this case explicitly, for example by raising a `TypeError` with a more informative message.
