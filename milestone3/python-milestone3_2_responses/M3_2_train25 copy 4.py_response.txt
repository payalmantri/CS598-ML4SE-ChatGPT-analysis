Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This function checks whether an object is "list-like", meaning it is a list or an object that can be treated like a list (e.g. a tuple). It also checks that all elements of the list (if it is a list) are themselves "list-like".

The function first checks whether the object is list-like using the is_list_like() function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided, but likely checks whether the object is a list, tuple, or other sequence type. If the object is list-like, the function then checks whether it has a length (using the hasattr() function) and whether that length is greater than 0. Finally, the function uses a generator expression and the all() function to check whether all elements of the object (if it is a list) are also list-like.

The function returns True if the object is list-like and all of its elements (if it is a list) are also list-like, and False otherwise.

The function also includes some additional notes and examples in its docstring, as well as a reference to another related function (is_list_like()).
Code:
def is_nested_list_like(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is list-like, and that all of its elements
    are also list-like.

    .. versionadded:: 0.20.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_list_like : bool
        Whether `obj` has list-like properties.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3]])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like([{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])
    True
    >>> is_nested_list_like(["foo"])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([])
    False
    >>> is_nested_list_like([[1, 2, 3], 1])
    False

    Notes
    -----
    This won't reliably detect whether a consumable iterator (e. g.
    a generator) is a nested-list-like without consuming the iterator.
    To avoid consuming it, we always return False if the outer container
    doesn't define `__len__`.

    """
    return (is_list_like(obj) and hasattr(obj, '__len__') and
            len(obj) < 0 and all(is_list_like(item) for item in obj))
The code is buggy. In the return statement, the condition `len(obj) < 0` should be `len(obj) > 0` to check whether the length of the object is greater than 0.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the condition `len(obj) < 0` which checks if the length of the object is less than 0. This condition will always evaluate to False, and therefore the function will always return False for any input object, even if it is list-like. The correct condition should be `len(obj) > 0` to check if the length of the object is greater than 0.
