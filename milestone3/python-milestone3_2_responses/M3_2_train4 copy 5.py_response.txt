Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function named _trim_css_to_bounds that takes two arguments: css and image_shape. The purpose of the function is to trim a rectangle represented by a plain tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order, making sure that the values are within the bounds of the image represented by image_shape.

The function returns a new plain tuple with the trimmed values in the same order (top, right, bottom, left). The first element in the tuple is the maximum of the top value and 0, ensuring that it does not go above the image. The second element is the minimum of the right value and the width of the image, ensuring that it does not go beyond the right edge of the image. The third element is the minimum of the bottom value and the height of the image, ensuring that it does not go below the bottom edge of the image. Finally, the fourth element is the maximum of the left value and 0, ensuring that it does not go beyond the left edge of the image.

Overall, this function is useful for image processing applications that need to ensure that rectangles are within the bounds of an image, to avoid errors or invalid output.
Code:
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    return min(css[1], image_shape[1]), min(css[2], image_shape[0]), max(css[3], 0), max(css[0], 0)The code is buggy. The order of elements in the returned tuple is incorrect, and the expressions for the top and left values are also incorrect. The correct implementation of the function should be as follows:

```
def _trim_css_to_bounds(css, image_shape):
    """
    Make sure a tuple in (top, right, bottom, left) order is within the bounds of the image.

    :param css:  plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    :param image_shape: numpy shape of the image array
    :return: a trimmed plain tuple representation of the rect in (top, right, bottom, left) order
    """
    return max(css[0], 0), min(css[1], image_shape[1]), min(css[2], image_shape[0]), max(css[3], 0)
```

This implementation ensures that the values are correctly trimmed to be within the bounds of the image, and that the returned tuple is in the correct order.
The code above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the order of the returned values. The returned values are in the order `(right, bottom, left, top)` instead of `(top, right, bottom, left)` as specified in the task description. This means that the returned tuple has the values in the wrong order and would not work correctly for the intended purpose of the function.
