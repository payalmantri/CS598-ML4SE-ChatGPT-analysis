Given that the following code should do the following task, is the code buggy or not?

Task:
This is a Python function that infers the schema of a data row. The function takes in two arguments: row and names.

The row argument can be a dictionary, tuple, list, named tuple, or an object. If it is a dictionary, the function sorts the items in the dictionary by key and value. If it is a tuple, list, or named tuple, the function checks if the row has fields. If it does, the function zips the fields with their respective values. If not, the function creates a default list of field names or adds additional field names to the provided list of field names. Finally, if the row is an object, the function sorts the items in the object's dictionary.

After inferring the fields and their respective data types, the function creates a StructType object, which is a data type in the Apache Spark framework that represents the schema of a DataFrame. The schema is represented by a list of StructField objects, where each StructField object represents a field in the schema. The StructField constructor takes in three arguments: the name of the field, the data type of the field, and a boolean value that indicates whether the field can be null.

Overall, this function infers the schema of a data row and returns a StructType object that can be used to create a DataFrame in Apache Spark.
Code:
def _infer_schema(row, names=None):
    """Infer the schema from dict/namedtuple/object"""
    if isinstance(row, dict):
        items = sorted(row.items())

    elif isinstance(row, (tuple, list)):
        if hasattr(row, "__fields__"):  # Row
            items = zip(row.__fields__, tuple(row))
        elif hasattr(row, "_fields"):  # namedtuple
            items = zip(row._fields, tuple(row))
        else:
            if names is None:
                names = ['_%d' % i for i in range(1, len(row) + 1)]
            elif len(names) <= len(row):
                names.extend('_%d' % i for i in range(len(names) + 1, len(row) + 1))
            items = zip(names, row)

    elif hasattr(row, "__dict__"):  # object
        items = sorted(row.__dict__.items())

    else:
        raise TypeError("Can not infer schema for type: %s" % type(row))

    fields = [StructField(k, _infer_type(v), True) for k, v in items]
    return StructType(fields)
The code provided looks correct to me. The change made to the `elif` condition for handling tuples, lists, and namedtuples is to ensure that `names` is extended only if its length is less than or equal to the length of `row`. This avoids adding duplicate field names to `names` and potentially raising an error when creating the StructType object.
The code I provided above is buggy. Where is the bug?
The bug in the code is in the following line:

```
elif len(names) <= len(row):
```

The `<=` operator should be replaced with `<` to ensure that additional field names are only added when the number of provided names is less than the number of fields in the row. Otherwise, an extra field name will be added even if the number of provided names is equal to the number of fields in the row, leading to incorrect schema inference. 

The corrected line should be:

```
elif len(names) < len(row):
```
