 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent code to the given function
Code:
def is_sequence(obj):
    """
    Check if the object is a sequence of objects.
    String types are not included as sequences here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : The object to check

    Returns
    -------
    is_sequence : bool
        Whether `obj` is a sequence of objects.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>>
    >>> is_sequence(l)
    True
    >>> is_sequence(iter(l))
    False
    """

    try:
        iter(obj)  # Can iterate over it.
        len(obj)   # Has a length associated with it.
        return not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes))
    except (TypeError, AttributeError):
        return False

----------------------------------------
 Prompt: are lists, tuples and ranges the only python types that have the iter function and the len functions defined on them, or could we have a custom data type that satisfies this
-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: No, lists, tuples, and ranges are not the only Python types that have the iter() and len() functions defined on them. Other built-in sequence types such as strings, bytes, and bytearrays also support these functions. In addition, custom objects can implement the __iter__() and __len__() methods to support iteration and length calculation, respectively.

For example, we can define a custom sequence class that implements these methods:

ruby
Copy code
class MySequence:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.data)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
In this case, we have defined a custom MySequence class that wraps a list of data and implements the __iter__() and __len__() methods. This class can be used as a sequence in the is_sequence() function, and the function will correctly return True if MySequence objects are passed as inputs.

So, the is_sequence() function is not limited to only built-in sequence types but can also work with any custom object that implements the necessary methods.
