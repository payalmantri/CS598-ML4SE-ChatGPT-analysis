----------------------------------------
 Prompt: can you write semantically equivalent code to the given function
Code:
def _do_perspective_warp(c:FlowField, targ_pts:Points, invert=False):
    "Apply warp to `targ_pts` from `_orig_pts` to `c` `FlowField`."
    if invert: return _apply_perspective(c, _find_coeffs(targ_pts, _orig_pts))
    return _apply_perspective(c, _find_coeffs(_orig_pts, targ_pts))
-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: import numpy as np
from mylibrary import FlowField, Points, _apply_perspective, _find_coeffs

def do_perspective_warp(c:FlowField, orig_pts:Points, targ_pts:Points, invert=False):
    "Apply warp to `targ_pts` from `orig_pts` to `c` `FlowField`."
    if invert:
        coeffs = _find_coeffs(targ_pts, orig_pts)
    else:
        coeffs = _find_coeffs(orig_pts, targ_pts)
    return _apply_perspective(c, coeffs)
