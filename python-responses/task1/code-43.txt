 Prompt: what does the following code do?
Code:
def adjust_learning_rate(optimizer, epoch, gammas, schedule):
  """Sets the learning rate to the initial LR decayed by 10 every 30 epochs"""
  lr = args.learning_rate
  assert len(gammas) == len(schedule), "length of gammas and schedule should be equal"
  for (gamma, step) in zip(gammas, schedule):
    if (epoch >= step):
      lr = lr * gamma
    else:
      break
  for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = lr
  return lr

ChatGPT response: The given function adjust_learning_rate is used to adjust the learning rate of an optimizer at every epoch according to a predefined schedule.

The function takes in four arguments:

optimizer: the optimizer object for which the learning rate needs to be adjusted.
epoch: the current epoch number.
gammas: a list of scaling factors to be applied to the learning rate at specific steps defined in schedule.
schedule: a list of epoch indices at which to multiply the learning rate by the corresponding gamma value.
The function first initializes the learning rate lr with the initial learning rate args.learning_rate (which is not defined in the given code). Then, it checks if the length of gammas and schedule is equal. If not, it raises an assertion error.

Next, for each pair of (gamma, step) in zip(gammas, schedule), it checks if the current epoch is greater than or equal to step. If it is, then it updates the learning rate lr by multiplying it with gamma. If the current epoch is less than step, it breaks out of the loop. Finally, it sets the learning rate of all parameter groups in the optimizer to lr and returns lr.
