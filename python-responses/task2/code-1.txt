    unittest.main()In this example, the test image test_image.jpg contains two known faces labeled 'person1' and 'person2', and an unknown face. We first load a trained KNN classifier from a pickled file, and then call the predict function with the test image and the loaded KNN classifier.

We then use the assertEqual and assertLess methods from unittest.TestCase to check that the expected number of faces were detected, that the predicted names are correct, and that the predicted locations are within the expected range.

Note that this is just an example test case and it assumes the existence of a test image and a trained KNN model. In practice, you would need to modify this test case to use appropriate test data for your particular application.


-----------------------------------------
 Prompt: why is the predicted location in your unit test on the order of 100s. For example, the 500 and 200 in self.assertLess(predictions[0][1][0], 500)
        self.assertGreater(predictions[0][1][1], 200)
-----------------------------------------
ChatGPT response: In the example unit test, the predicted locations are on the order of 100s because the locations returned by the face_locations function of the face_recognition library are pixel coordinates of the bounding boxes surrounding the detected faces in the image.

The assertLess and assertGreater methods in the unit test are used to ensure that the predicted face locations are within an expected range of pixel coordinates. In the example, the specific values of 500 and 200 were chosen arbitrarily as thresholds for the x and y coordinates of the top left corner of the bounding box for the first detected face. Similarly, the values of 700 and 500 were chosen arbitrarily for the second face, and 400 and 200 were chosen for the third (unknown) face.

In practice, the expected range of pixel coordinates will depend on the resolution and aspect ratio of the input image, the size and position of the faces in the image, and the specific requirements of the application. The expected range of pixel coordinates should be chosen based on domain knowledge of the problem and the specific requirements of the application.
